# Detectors

This page is the **file** plane: the detectors that read a file's bytes. The
runtime planes have their own pages — the process table in
[cli.md](cli.md#cau-ps), persistence in [cli.md](cli.md#cau-persist), and the
network plane, its blocker and the cross-host intake in
[network.md](network.md).

Every file is read once. The same buffer is hashed, scanned by libyara, and
handed to the heuristic, static and stego passes; the fusion lattice then
joins their outcomes. Each detector answers a different question:

| Detector | Question | Tier on a hit |
|---|---|---|
| [Hash signatures](#hash-signatures) | is this exact content known? | MALICIOUS |
| [YARA](#yara) | does it contain patterns a rule author described? | MALICIOUS |
| [Heuristics](#heuristics) | does it name suspicious capabilities? | SUSPICIOUS |
| [Static structure](#static-structure) | is it *built* like something that hides? | SUSPICIOUS |
| [Invisible codepoints](#invisible-codepoints-stego) | does this text or code carry hidden codepoints? | SUSPICIOUS |
| [Encoded executable](#encoded-executable) | is an executable hidden behind text encoding? | SUSPICIOUS |
| [Obfuscation-chain peeler](#obfuscation-chain-peeler) | is a payload stacked behind several layers? | SUSPICIOUS |
| [Shell Link (.lnk)](#shell-link-lnk) | is this Windows shortcut a weaponised launcher? | SUSPICIOUS |
| [OLE macro](#ole-macro) | does this Office document carry a malicious VBA macro? | SUSPICIOUS |
| [PDF document](#pdf-document) | does this PDF auto-run code or carry a payload? | SUSPICIOUS |
| [ISO container](#iso-container) | is this disk image a mark-of-the-web-bypass lure? | SUSPICIOUS |
| [Linux software package](#linux-software-package) | does an install-time script run root-level tradecraft? | SUSPICIOUS |
| [Archive](#archive) | is this container a bomb, a Zip-Slip, or a lure around a payload? | SUSPICIOUS |
| [CHM help file](#chm-help-file) | does this help file smuggle an executable, shortcut or script? | SUSPICIOUS |
| [Tradecraft](#tradecraft) | does this file *do* something behavioural — a web/net/in-memory shell, a GTFOBins or LOLBAS primitive, a trusted-SaaS C2 channel, an EDR-bypass pairing? | SUSPICIOUS |
| [Fusion](#fusion) | do several of the above agree, even below their own thresholds? | never lowers; raises CLEAN to SUSPICIOUS |

SUSPICIOUS is evidence with a score and an explanation, never a confirmed
detection; MALICIOUS is reserved for content that is known. The reports keep
the two apart, and `--fail-on` lets a pipeline choose which one it acts on.

## Hash signatures

MD5, SHA-1 and SHA-256 are computed in one streaming pass and looked up in
the signature database, SHA-256 first. Loading validates every entry (known
type, hexadecimal, exact length for the type) and rejects duplicates; a digest
re-listed under a different name is reported as a conflict and the first
entry kept. Rejected lines are warnings, never silent drops, so the reported
signature count is the number of hashes that can actually match.

A hash hit carries the digest type, the digest and the threat name.

## YARA

Rules are compiled once at startup with libyara (through go-yara) and matched
in memory. A rule file that does not compile is reported with file, line and
column and skipped; the rest of the ruleset still loads; a ruleset with no
usable rule is a hard error. Compiler warnings (slow strings, rules that can
never match) are shown, not suppressed.

Each match carries the rule name, the namespace libyara reports (not a file
name), tags, the full `meta:` block and every matched string with its absolute
offset. A per-file timeout (`--yara-timeout`, 30 s) bounds adversarial
inputs; matches found before the timeout are kept and the timeout is recorded
as a warning on the file.

Rule conventions (`ascii wide`, `threat_level`, `family`, `mitre_attack`) are
described in [Detection content](detection-content.md).

## Heuristics

The heuristic pass scores two kinds of evidence: Windows API names in a PE
import table, and substrings of the printable ASCII and UTF-16LE strings of
any file. The scoring model exists because the original implementation scored
every string that contained `http://`, so a binary carrying its certificate
chain scored sixteen points from CRL URLs alone:

1. A pattern scores **once per file**, however many strings contain it.
2. Every category has a cap; five crypto imports are not five times as
   suspicious as one.
3. The weak categories (networking, timers, file deletion, discovery, temp
   paths, memory protection, Unix shell and download-tool references) share a
   budget of 2 points in total, so ordinary program behaviour never adds up to
   a detection.
4. An API credited from the import table is not scored again as a string.

The threshold (7) was chosen on the 349 files of Kali's Windows tool set so
that single-capability binaries stay below it and multi-stage behaviour
(injection plus persistence, credential access plus network, encoded
PowerShell plus download) crosses it. That retune cut detections from 60 to
28; plink went 24 → 5, vncviewer 11 → 4, dbghelp.dll 13 → 4, while mimikatz,
wce, pwdump and PowerSploit stayed detected. OllyDbg still scores 11: a
debugger has exactly the import profile of a process injector, and the report
names the imports responsible.

Every category maps to an ATT&CK technique, rendered in text and JSON and
carried into fused verdicts:

| Category | Cap | Technique |
|---|---|---|

| Kernel Rootkit | 6 | T1014 |

Import names come from the PE import table or, for ELF, the undefined dynamic
symbols (a kernel module's undefined `.symtab` entries). The Linux entries
are few on purpose, because an ELF import table names libc and libc is not
evidence: `ptrace`, `process_vm_readv` / `process_vm_writev` and
`pidfd_getfd` score as injection (`sudo`, `strace` and `gdb` import them
legitimately and stay below the threshold), and Kernel Rootkit holds what a
module needs to find and patch kernel text (`kallsyms_lookup_name`,
`register_kprobe`, `ftrace_set_filter_ip`, `set_memory_rw`, `text_poke`,
`sys_call_table`), which no ordinary driver imports.

The indicator tables are in `scanner/heuristics.go`; `scanner.Categories()`
returns this table programmatically.

## Static structure

`scanner/static` asks whether a file is built like something that is hiding.
It runs on every file type; the PE parts run on PE images, the ELF parts on
ELF images (32- and 64-bit, both byte orders: executables, shared objects,
relocatable objects and kernel modules), and the Mach-O parts on Mach-O images
(thin and universal/fat, 32- and 64-bit, both byte orders).

- **Entropy**: whole-file Shannon entropy plus a 256-byte sliding window, so
  a compressed tail inside an otherwise ordinary file shows as a high-entropy
  fraction.
- **Fuzzy digests**: TLSH and ssdeep for every file, imphash for PE files
  (pefile-compatible, including the ws2_32 / wsock32 / oleaut32 ordinal
  tables). With a fuzzy database, matches become evidence: TLSH distance ≤ 30
  or ssdeep score ≥ 70, always reported with the distance and the matched
  entry's name.
- **PE anatomy** from an own parser that checks every offset against the
  buffer (the standard library's `debug/pe` drops ordinal imports, which
  breaks imphash, and trusts header sizes): sections with permissions and
  entropy, entry-point placement, import profile, delay and bound imports,
  exports, debug directory and PDB path (metadata only, never scored), TLS
  callbacks, overlay with the certificate table separated out, the Rich header
  with its checksum, and the Authenticode certificate chain.
- **ELF anatomy** from an own parser under the same rule (`debug/elf` trusts
  header counts and allocates what they declare): program headers with
  permissions and entropy, section headers with the stripped and
  pointing-outside-the-file cases named, `PT_INTERP`, the dynamic table
  (`DT_NEEDED`, `SONAME`, `RPATH` / `RUNPATH`, `DT_INIT`, text relocations,
  PIE and bind-now flags), undefined and defined dynamic symbols (a
  relocatable object's `.symtab` instead), GNU build-id and ABI notes,
  `.modinfo` and the appended kernel-module signature, overlay with the
  signature separated out, AppImage magic, UPX markers, an import-set hash for
  clustering (MD5 over the sorted undefined symbol names; a CAU key), and
  **telfhash** (Trend Micro's TLSH over the filtered symbol set) when the
  binary clears TLSH's 50-byte floor, with an honest note when it does not.
  Deep-resolution anomalies resolve `.init_array`/`.preinit_array` constructor
  pointers through the relocations and flag one landing
  `dynamic.init-array-outside-code`, read symbol versions from
  `.gnu.version_r`/`_d` (`dynamic.symbol-versions`, informational), and flag a
  raw-syscall libc interposer (`dynamic.preload-interposer-syscall`).
- **Mach-O anatomy** from an own parser: the universal/fat architecture list,
  segments and sections with permissions and entropy, linked dylibs and an
  import hash over the dylib set, `LC_RPATH`, the `LC_MAIN`/`LC_UNIXTHREAD`
  entry point, code-signature presence (`LC_CODE_SIGNATURE`, unverified),
  encryption (`LC_ENCRYPTION_INFO` `cryptid`), and symbol imports/exports. Its
  anomaly classes (`macho.*`) name RWX and high-entropy segments, code in a
  writable section, an entry point outside or in a non-executable segment, an
  executable stack, an encrypted or packed region, insecure `@rpath`/dylib
  paths, and an unsigned or unverified signature.

Findings are labeled **anomaly classes**, each with a weight, a category and
an ATT&CK technique where one applies. Categories are capped (Sections 5,
Entry Point 4, Headers 3, Imports 3, Packer 4, Signature 8, Overlay 2,
Format 3, Similarity 8; for ELF also Dynamic Linking 4 and Kernel Module 3)
and the threshold is 8, so several independent things must be wrong at once.

| Class | Weight | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `section.rwx` | 3 | writable and executable section (T1027.009); a kernel driver's `INIT` is exempt |
| `section.exec-high-entropy` | 2 | executable section above 7.0 bits/byte (T1027) |
| `section.name-perm-mismatch` | 2 | `.text` not executable, data section executable (T1036) |
| `section.virtual-raw-mismatch` | 2 | executable section far larger in memory than on disk: an unpack target (T1027.002) |
| `section.exec-unusual-name` | 1 | executable section with a non-compiler name |
| `entrypoint.zero`, `.outside-sections`, `.non-exec-section`, `.zero-raw-section`, `.last-writable-section` | 2, 3, 2, 3, 1 | where the entry point lands |
| `tls.callbacks` | 1 | code that runs before the entry point |
| `header.timestamp-zero`, `-future`, `-ancient`, `-mismatch` | 1, 2, 1, 2 | link-time inconsistencies (T1070.006); Delphi's constant 1992 stamp and reproducible builds are explicit non-findings |
| `rich.checksum-invalid`, `rich.missing-msvc` | 2, 1 | copied or stripped build record (T1036) |
| `header.low-alignment` | 1 | hand-built or squeezed image |
| `imports.none`, `.empty-descriptors`, `.loader-only`, `.minimal` | 2, 2, 2, 1–2 | import table that says nothing (T1027.007) |
| `packer.generic` / `packer.<name>` | 3 / 2 | packed profile; a recognised packer (UPX, ASPack, Themida, VMProtect, ...) weighs *less* because the report names it; installer stubs are informational |
| `packer.credential-imports` | 3 | a *packed* executable whose import table still names the credential stores' own libraries (`samlib`, `samsrv`, `cryptdll`, `lsasrv`, `vaultcli` and the authentication packages), or a credential API that happened to survive (`SamConnect`, `LsaRetrievePrivateData`, `LsaFreeReturnBuffer`, the vault enumerators) (T1003). A packer keeps one import from each library so the loader can map it: the list of libraries survives packing, and so does the function list, because a packer that keeps the import table keeps the names the loader needs to rebuild the address table. All five packed tools in the corpus keep theirs. The libraries a remote dumper shares with every file manager and every Qt program are deliberately not read |
| `overlay.high-entropy`, `overlay.present` | 2, 1 | data appended past the last section (T1027.009) |
| `authenticode.vendor-name-self-signed` | 6 | a self-signed certificate wearing a well-known vendor's name crosses the threshold on its own (T1036.001) |
| `authenticode.self-signed`, `.no-codesign-eku`, `.long-validity`, `.compiled-outside-validity`, `.parse-error` | 3, 2, 1, 2, 1 | signer implausibility (T1553.002, T1070.006, T1036.001) |
| `format.truncated`, `.section-overlap`, `.no-sections`, `.unparseable` | 2 each | malformed images |
| `fuzzy.tlsh`, `fuzzy.ssdeep`, `fuzzy.imphash` | 8, 5–8, 4 | similarity to a database entry |

ELF classes (the shared names above keep their weights; `segment.*` is the
`PT_LOAD` view):

| Class | Weight | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `segment.rwx` | 3 | writable and executable `PT_LOAD` (T1027.009) |
| `segment.exec-high-entropy`, `segment.virtual-raw-mismatch` | 2, 2 | executable segment above 7.0 bits/byte; executable segment far larger in memory than on disk (T1027, T1027.002) |
| `section.headers-missing` | 2 | no section table at all: sstrip, a packer or a hand-built loader (T1027.002) |
| `section.name-perm-mismatch`, `section.exec-unusual-name` | 2, 1 | as for PE; the kernel's own executable section names and `.text.*` are exempt |
| `entrypoint.zero`, `.outside-segments`, `.non-exec-segment`, `.outside-sections`, `.non-exec-section` | 2, 3, 2, 2, 2 | where the entry point lands |
| `segment.exec-stack`, `segment.no-gnu-stack` | 2, 1 | `PT_GNU_STACK` requests an executable stack, or is absent from a dynamically linked image |
| `dynamic.interp-unusual` | 2 | program interpreter outside the system loader directories or not named like a loader (T1574) |
| `dynamic.rpath-insecure` | 2 | `RPATH` / `RUNPATH` with a relative or empty component, or under `/tmp`, `/dev/shm`, `/home` and the like (T1574); `$ORIGIN` idioms are informational |
| `dynamic.needed-path`, `dynamic.textrel`, `dynamic.init-outside-code` | 1, 1, 2 | dependency named by path; text relocations; `DT_INIT` outside executable memory (T1574, T1027) |
| `dynamic.preload-interposer` | 3 | a shared object that defines two or more of the libc entry points preload rootkits replace (`readdir`, `open`, `stat`, `accept`, `execve`, `ptrace`, ...) and imports `dlsym` to reach the originals (T1574.006); sanitizer runtimes, fakeroot, `libeatmydata`, sudo's noexec shims and other known interposers are reported at weight 0 under `-known` |
| `imports.none`, `.loader-only`, `.minimal` | 2, 2, 1–2 | a dynamically linked image that imports nothing, only `dlopen` / `dlsym` and memory calls, or three or fewer substantive symbols (T1027.007); statically linked images are informational |
| `packer.upx` / `packer.generic` | 2 / 3 | UPX by its `UPX!` markers (the copyright banner alone is not evidence: the `upx` binary carries it); otherwise no section table plus a packed executable segment plus nothing imported |
| `overlay.present`, `overlay.high-entropy` | 1, 2 | data past the end of every header, segment and section (T1027.009); an AppImage's appended filesystem is informational |
| `module.unsigned`, `module.info-missing` | 1, 2 | a kernel module without an appended signature (presence only: the keyring is not here), or without `.modinfo` vermagic (T1014) |
| `header.class-machine-mismatch`, `format.program-table-invalid`, `format.section-table-invalid`, `format.truncated`, `format.interp-without-dynamic`, `format.type-unknown` | 1, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2 | malformed images; a section table pointing outside the file is the classic trick that breaks analysis tools while the loader does not care |

Honesty rules baked into the output: packed is not malicious (a Debian-shipped
UPX binary is packed, correctly, by provenance); signature presence is not
validity (nothing is verified against a trust store, `verified` is always
`false` and the report says so); similarity is evidence, not identity.
Measured on the 49 PE files in `/usr/share/windows-resources`, 43 score 0,
the UPX-packed `wget.exe` scores 7 and renders as low suspicion with the
packer named, nothing crosses the threshold, and credential tools score 0 here
by design because capability is the heuristic pass's job.
Measured on 4,999 ELF files under Kali's `/usr/bin`, `/usr/sbin`,
`/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu`, `/usr/libexec` and `/usr/lib/systemd` plus 40
signed kernel modules, nothing crosses the threshold and 21 files carry a
single weight-1 observation (launcher stubs with three or fewer imports,
vendor executable sections such as libGL's `wtext`); a UPX-packed `ls`
scores 6 and renders as low suspicion with the packer named; `libasan`,
`libeatmydata` and sudo's noexec shims are named as known interposers at
weight 0.

`static.Classes()` returns this catalog programmatically, with a test that
pins it to the emitting code; `cau coverage` reads it.
`cau hash` prints the digests, `cau cluster` groups PE and ELF files by
import similarity (exact imphash or ELF import-set hash, then MinHash / LSH
over import sets).

## Invisible codepoints (stego)

`scanner/stego` examines text artifacts (valid UTF-8, or UTF-16 with a
byte-order mark; binary content is skipped and the reason recorded) for
codepoints that have no glyph:

| Class | Codepoints | Weight | What it carries |
|---|---|---|---|
| `zero-width` | ZERO WIDTH SPACE / NON-JOINER / JOINER, WORD JOINER, the invisible operators, COMBINING GRAPHEME JOINER, MONGOLIAN VOWEL SEPARATOR, ZERO WIDTH NO-BREAK SPACE | 6 | the alphabet of zero-width steganography: README dead-drop channels, payloads between the words of a comment |
| `bidi-control` | directional embeddings, overrides and isolates (U+202A–U+202E, U+2066–U+2069) | 6 | Trojan Source (CVE-2021-42574): source that compiles differently from how it is displayed |
| `tag` | U+E0000–U+E007F | 6 | invisible copies of ASCII used to smuggle text past filters and into language models |
| `variation-selector` | U+FE00–U+FE0F, U+E0100–U+E01EF where no base character wants them | 4 | 256 invisible values make a byte alphabet |
| informational | LEFT-TO-RIGHT / RIGHT-TO-LEFT MARK, ARABIC LETTER MARK, SOFT HYPHEN | 0 | recorded, never scored |

Detection is **presence-based**: density thresholds are the first thing an
encoder drops below. What keeps it usable is a closed list of context rules,
each named in the report when it applies:

- U+FEFF at offset 0 is a byte-order mark.
- ZERO WIDTH JOINER next to a pictographic codepoint, a skin-tone modifier or
  a presentation selector is an emoji sequence.
- ZERO WIDTH JOINER / NON-JOINER next to a script that uses joiners (Arabic,
  Persian, Hebrew, the Indic scripts, Myanmar, Khmer, Mongolian, ...) is
  typography.
- ZERO WIDTH SPACE next to a script written without inter-word spaces (Khmer,
  Thai, Lao, Myanmar, Tibetan) is that script's word separator.
- A directional control on a line that holds right-to-left text is
  bidirectional typesetting; on a line of ASCII it stays scored.
- VARIATION SELECTOR-15/16 directly after an emoji is presentation; a CJK
  variation selector directly after a CJK ideograph is an ideographic variant;
  a selector after anything else, or a second selector in a row, carries data.
- TAG characters inside a subdivision-flag sequence (after U+1F3F4) are a
  flag.

Two modifiers raise the score without being findings: a run of eight or more
consecutive invisible codepoints (`stego.payload-run`, payloads have length)
and codepoints whose visible neighbours on both sides are ASCII
(`stego.ascii-carrier`, the dead-drop pattern). The default threshold (4) is
reached by any scored class; `--stego-threshold 8` requires a modifier too.

The report lists every codepoint with its count, how many occurrences a
context rule excused and which rule, the first line and byte offset, and up
to two bounded examples with the invisibles rendered as `<U+200B>`.

Measured on 70,200 benign text artifacts (every text file under Kali's
`/usr/share/doc` and `/usr/lib/python3/dist-packages`) the pass fires on 69,
a 0.10 % false-positive rate, and on none of the 294 text files in
`/usr/share/windows-resources`; the context rules excused 35,187 legitimate
uses — 21,939 emoji sequences and 11,258 emoji presentation selectors, 1,635
joining-script joiners, 126 subdivision flags, 84 byte-order marks, 74
spaceless-script spaces and 71 bidirectional controls. The remaining false
positives are the two documented classes: a stray
ZERO WIDTH SPACE pasted into documentation or a translation file, and source
files that enumerate Unicode categories. See [Limitations](limitations.md).

This is the engine half of the plan's NOVEL-001 / NOVEL-002 rows; findings
carry `technique: T1027` and `novel: NOVEL-001`.

## Encoded executable

`scanner/encchain` answers a question the byte-pattern detectors cannot: is a
PE or ELF image hidden behind one or more layers of base64 or hex encoding? An
encoded executable has no contiguous `MZ`/`\x7fELF` sequence for a hash, YARA
rule or heuristic to match, so a dropper that carries its payload base64-encoded
in a script, document or `.bs64` blob slips past them.

The detector scans for base64 and hex runs (MIME line-wrapping tolerated),
decodes each — bounded by a layer cap, a byte budget and a candidate cap so a
decode bomb cannot exhaust it — and reports a finding when a decoded layer is a
**valid** PE header (the `MZ` magic plus a `PE\0\0` signature at the
`e_lfanew` offset) or ELF header (the magic plus a valid class, data encoding
and version). Peeling more than one layer is reported with its depth. The
signal is content-anchored: the decoded bytes are an executable, which an
attacker cannot shed without losing the payload. It is the engine half of the
plan's NOVEL-012; findings carry `technique` T1027.013 (a straight decode) or
T1140 (through layers) and `novel` NOVEL-012.

It is SUSPICIOUS-tier, never MALICIOUS: an embedded encoded binary is strong
evidence, not proof of malice (installers and security tools carry them too).
Measured over 139,860 benign files from a Kali install — `/usr/share/doc`,
`/usr/lib/python3/dist-packages`, `/usr/share/nmap` and
`/usr/share/metasploit-framework` — it fired on 26 (0.019 %), every one a
genuine embedded encoded executable: Metasploit module documentation with its
own carve chains, and the `lsassy` and `nxc` embedded payloads.
`--no-encchain` disables it and `--encchain-threshold` tunes the score.

## Obfuscation-chain peeler

`internal/peeler` asks what the other detectors cannot: not what a payload is, but
how many layers it is hidden behind. The depth of a chain is evidence by itself.
The [ADS](ads/obfuscation-chain.md) covers strategy and blind spots, and
[`cau peel`](cli.md#cau-peel) runs it alone.

It walks a tree. At each node every layer that applies decodes at once, and each
result opens a branch, so layers chain in any order and one blob can open several
branches. A branch ends at a recognised executable or script, and scripts are
recognised without a shebang.

| Layers | |
|---|---|
| Bases | 2, 8, 10, 16 (bare or as lists such as `72 101`, `0x48,0x65`, `\x48\x65`, `%48%65`); 32 (RFC 4648, lower case, hex, Crockford, z-base-32); 36; 45; 58 (Bitcoin, Flickr, Ripple); 62; 64 (standard, URL-safe, line-wrapped); 85 (RFC 1924, Ascii85, Z85); 91; 92 |
| Substitutions | every Caesar shift, rot5, rot18, rot47, atbash, reversal |
| Other | gzip, zlib, raw deflate, bzip2, UTF-16, and blobs carved out of a surrounding script |

A substitution has to reveal something, because rotating text only gives more text
and every layer adds to the score. A rotation is judged on the first 4 KiB, and on
text it is chosen by letter frequency instead of being tried 25 times, which keeps
this cheap on every file a scan reads. A carve needs a run of at least 64 characters
with a payload inside it, and it is not counted as a layer, because it decodes
nothing: one base64 blob in a script is the same packaging as one base64 file.

| Class | Weight | Fires when |
|---|---|---|
| `peel.revealed-executable` | 60 | a PE or ELF at depth 2 or more, or behind a substitution |
| `peel.revealed-script` | 40 | a script at depth 2 or more, or behind a substitution |
| `peel.exhausted` | 30 | a chain outlived the budget, which is never reported as clean |

Depth past 2 adds 15 per layer, and a substitution adds 15 at any depth, because no
packaging tool writes one. The threshold is 50. One budget covers the whole tree:
512 nodes, 64 MiB of decoded output, depth 32, 6 branches per node, 5 seconds.
Everything is T1027 and NOVEL-012, and the chain signature, such as
`base64>rot13>flate`, is the family key. Over 130,673 benign files it flagged
10 (0.0077 %), all real payloads inside offensive tooling.

## Shell Link (.lnk)

`scanner/lnk` reads the Windows Shell Link ([MS-SHLLINK]) binary format and
asks whether a shortcut is a weaponised launcher — the classic ISO/ZIP lure
that drops a `.lnk` whose arguments relaunch an interpreter. It parses the
ShellLinkHeader, the optional LinkTargetIDList and LinkInfo, the StringData
sections (name, relative path, working directory, **command-line arguments**,
icon location) and the ExtraData blocks, through a bounds-checked cursor that
caps every declared size and never recurses, so a truncated or adversarial
shortcut yields a partial result with a warning rather than a panic.

The findings are small additive signals, each mapped to ATT&CK: an interpreter
or LOLBin in the arguments (`powershell`→T1059.001, `cmd`→T1059.003,
`wscript`/`cscript`→T1059.005, `mshta`/`rundll32`/`regsvr32`/… →T1059), encoded
or obfuscated command flags (`-enc`, `FromBase64String`, `IEX`, …→T1027), a
hidden-window flag (T1027), environment-variable path obfuscation (T1027), an
executable or script target (T1204.002), a document-icon lure fronting an
interpreter (T1204.002), unusually long arguments, and data appended past the
shortcut structures (T1027). The default threshold (8) is chosen so no single
benign tell crosses it while a real combination does — an interpreter plus an
encoded flag, or an interpreter plus a hidden window.

It is SUSPICIOUS-tier, never MALICIOUS: the structure is strong evidence of a
launcher, not proof of malice (legitimate installers ship shortcuts too).
`--no-lnk` disables it and `--lnk-threshold` tunes the score.

## OLE macro

`scanner/ole` reads the OLE Compound File Binary ([MS-CFB]) container behind
legacy-Office documents (`.doc`/`.xls`/`.ppt`) and asks whether it carries a
malicious VBA macro — the phishing-lure dropper that auto-runs on open and
shells out to an interpreter or pulls a stage-two payload. It parses the CFB
(header, DIFAT, FAT, directory, MiniFAT/mini-stream) through bounds-checked
accessors that cap every declared size, detect FAT/MiniFAT chain cycles with a
visited-set, and bound the total bytes resolved, so a malformed or adversarial
document yields a partial result with a warning rather than a panic, a hang or
unbounded memory. It then locates the VBA module streams, decompresses their
[MS-OVBA] `CompressedContainer` source (a bounded, cycle-free implementation of
the container/chunk/token algorithm), and reads the macro source.

The findings are ATT&CK-mapped signals: a VBA project at all (T1059.005, low
weight — legit docs have macros), an **auto-executing entry point**
(`AutoOpen`, `Document_Open`, `Workbook_Open`, … → T1137), a shell or
interpreter call (`Shell`, `powershell`, `cmd` → T1059.001/.003/.005), a
downloader (`URLDownloadToFile`, `MSXML2.XMLHTTP` → T1105), late-binding
(`CreateObject`/`GetObject`), heavy character-code obfuscation (T1027), and
embedded-object / Equation-Editor lures (`\x01Ole10Native`, `Equation Native` →
T1204.002 / T1203). The default threshold (8) is chosen so a plain
macro-bearing document stays below it while an auto-exec entry point plus a
suspicious call crosses it.

It is SUSPICIOUS-tier, never MALICIOUS: a macro is strong evidence, not proof
(business documents legitimately automate). `--no-ole` disables it and
`--ole-threshold` tunes the score.

## PDF document

`scanner/pdf` detects malicious PDFs — the phishing lure whose document
auto-runs JavaScript, launches an external program, or carries an embedded
payload. A full PDF parse is unnecessary and, on adversarial files, dangerous,
so the detector is a **bounded lexical + shallow-structural scan** (the tool
most PDF-malware detectors actually use): it never recurses, caps the bytes it
reads and the number of name tokens it processes, and returns a partial result
with a warning rather than hanging. It first resolves PDF name obfuscation —
names may hex-escape characters as `#xx` (`/J#61vaScript` is `/JavaScript`), so
matching is done against the decoded canonical name.

The ATT&CK-mapped signals: an auto-run action (`/OpenAction`, `/AA` → T1204.002),
embedded JavaScript (`/JavaScript`, `/JS` → T1059.007), a `/Launch` action
(T1059), an embedded-file payload (`/EmbeddedFile` → T1204.002), a remote fetch
(`/SubmitForm`, `/GoToR` → T1105), a `/URI` link (T1204.001, low weight),
JavaScript exploitation primitives (`unescape`, `eval`, `%u` heap-spray,
`getAnnots` → T1027), and — the strongest intent signal — a sensitive name
spelled with `#xx` hex escapes (T1027), which benign PDFs essentially never do.
Encryption is noted but never scored alone (many benign PDFs are encrypted); it
adds a tiny amplifier only when combined with an auto-run action and JavaScript.
The default threshold (8) is chosen so a plain PDF with a benign link stays well
below while the canonical `OpenAction`→`JavaScript` dropper crosses.

It is SUSPICIOUS-tier, never MALICIOUS. `--no-pdf` disables it and
`--pdf-threshold` tunes the score.

## ISO container

`scanner/iso` recognises the ISO/IMG email-smuggling delivery shape: attackers
mail a small `.iso` that, when mounted, shows a `.lnk` relaunching an
interpreter against a hidden payload — a route that became popular because
mounted-image contents historically did not inherit Mark-of-the-Web. The
detector reads the ISO 9660 directory tree (with Joliet UCS-2 names when
present) through a parser that is enumeration-only — it never reads file
contents — and bounded by construction: an explicit queue instead of recursion,
caps on records/sectors/entries/depth, a visited-set of extent LBAs that breaks
self-referential extents, and a range check on every sector and record, so a
malformed image yields a partial enumeration with a warning rather than a hang.

The ATT&CK-mapped signals: `autorun.inf` in the root (T1091), a `.lnk` shortcut
(T1204.002), an executable or script file (T1204.002), a hidden-flagged
executable or a payload inside a hidden directory (T1564.001), and — the
canonical lure — a `.lnk` present together with an executable payload
(`iso.lure.lnk-and-payload`, T1204.002), with a tiny extra weight when the image
is also small (the attachment shape). The default threshold (8) is tuned so a
legitimate software ISO full of executables does not cross on executables alone,
while the lnk-plus-payload smuggling shape does. The detector enumerates the
container shape; the files it names are scanned on their own by the other
detectors.

It is SUSPICIOUS-tier, never MALICIOUS. `--no-iso` disables it and
`--iso-threshold` tunes the score.

## Linux software package

`scanner/linuxpkg` scores the one thing every Linux software format has in
common: an install-time script the package manager runs **as root**.
`apt`/`dnf`/`pacman install` is a trust decision, and a software-supply-chain
payload (T1195.002) rides in on exactly that trust — a `preinst` that pipes a
remote download into a shell, an RPM `%post` that opens a reverse shell, a
`PKGBUILD` that drops an SSH key, a Flatpak manifest that escapes the sandbox.
The detector pulls those scripts out of the container and scores the behaviours
in them; it never installs, extracts to disk, or executes anything.

The formats it recognises from their public structure alone:

| Format | What it reads |
|---|---|
| Debian `.deb` | `ar` → `control.tar` maintainer scripts (`preinst`/`postinst`/`prerm`/`postrm`); `xz`/`zstd`-packed control members are noted "present but not decoded" |
| RPM `.rpm` | the uncompressed header's scriptlets (`%pre`/`%post`/`%preun`/`%postun`/`%pretrans`/`%posttrans`) and their declared interpreter |
| Arch `.pkg.tar(.zst/.xz/.gz)` | `.INSTALL` hooks and `PKGBUILD` recipes (`package()`/`prepare()`) |
| Flatpak | flatpak-builder manifests (`finish-args` sandbox-escape grants) and single-file bundles (OSTree payload not unpacked) |
| AppImage | type-2 images (self-mounting ELF with an appended SquashFS, runs unsandboxed) |
| Docker / OCI | `docker save` / `podman save` tarballs — image-config history `created_by`, `Cmd`/`Entrypoint`/`Env`, and layer entrypoint scripts |
| Snap | SquashFS packages and `classic`-confinement declarations (runs outside the snap sandbox) |
| Generic installers | `.zip`/`.tar` bundles carrying install shell scripts |
| Executable configs | `.desktop`/XDG autostart, systemd units, shell-rc `bash setup`, KDE autostart |
| APT/nala sources | `sources.list` and deb822 `.sources` (`trusted=yes`, IP-literal and `http` endpoints, piped `Signed-By`) |

The scored behaviours (stable `linuxpkg.*` classes, each ATT&CK-mapped) include
remote-download-into-shell (`curl|bash`), reverse/bind shell, decode-and-exec,
cryptominer, SSH `authorized_keys` backdoor, `sudoers` NOPASSWD, the
download→`chmod`→exec dropper, disable-defenses, anti-forensics, setuid, and
persistence via systemd/cron/shell-rc, plus the Flatpak permission grants and
the APT-source and Snap structural notes. Findings carry small additive weights
(default threshold 8, matching the sibling lnk/ole/pdf/iso detectors): a benign
`postinst` that runs `ldconfig` or `update-desktop-database` scores zero, while a
single reverse-shell or remote-download scriptlet crosses on its own.

Every parser is bounded (member, script, decompression and header-size caps) and
the codebase is stdlib-only, so members packed with `xz`/`zstd` and the SquashFS
inside an AppImage or Snap are recorded as "present but not inspected" rather than
guessed at. It is SUSPICIOUS-tier, never MALICIOUS alone, and feeds the fusion
lattice (so `--quarantine-level suspicious` can auto-block a packaged dropper).
`--no-pkg` disables it and `--pkg-threshold` tunes the score.

## Archive

`scanner/archive` treats a compressed container — ZIP, TAR, gzip and their
`tar.gz` nesting — as the subject of inspection in its own right. It asks
container-*hygiene* questions, not package-identity ones (that is the
`linuxpkg` detector's job): is this a **decompression bomb**, does a member
**escape the extraction root** (Zip-Slip / path traversal), is the single
member a **disguised executable**, is the payload **locked behind
encryption**. It never writes to disk, never executes a member, and bounds
every read (size, member count, decompression, magic peek) so a hostile
archive cannot make it allocate or decompress without limit — a gzip body
caps at 64 MiB, the member count at 100,000, the whole archive at 256 MiB.

The ATT&CK-mapped signals (`archive.*`): `bomb` (a compression ratio or
absolute expansion past the caps), `path-traversal` (a member whose path
escapes the root), `lure-double-extension` (e.g. `invoice.pdf.exe`,
T1036), `single-executable` and `script-member` (a container whose entire
reason to exist is to deliver one payload, T1204.002), `executable-member`,
`encrypted-entry` (a password-locked member hiding its contents from
inspection, T1027) and `nested-archive` (an archive inside the archive,
T1027). The default threshold is 8; a benign source tarball of ordinary
files scores zero, while a one-member `invoice.pdf.exe` ZIP crosses on the
double-extension-plus-single-executable combination alone.

It is SUSPICIOUS-tier, never MALICIOUS. `--no-archive` disables it and
`--archive-threshold` tunes the score.

## CHM help file

`scanner/chm` reads Compiled HTML Help (`.chm`, the ITSS container) for the
things a help file has no business carrying. It walks the uncompressed
ITSF/ITSP/PMGL directory and scores embedded payloads: `chm.embedded-executable`
(a lone `.exe`/`.dll`/`.scr` crosses on its own, weight 8 — no legitimate CHM
ships a PE), `chm.multiple-executables`, `chm.embedded-lnk`, and
`chm.embedded-script` for a dangerous script type (`.hta`/`.vbs`/`.ps1`/`.bat`/
`.cmd`/`.wsf`, but deliberately *not* plain `.js`, which help-file table-of-
contents navigation uses legitimately). Techniques T1204.002 and T1059.

Honest boundary: the LZX-compressed content section is **not** decompressed in
v1, so the HTML/script bodies and the classic malicious `<OBJECT>`
ShortCut/WinExec tradecraft inside them are not inspected — the pass records
"present but not inspected" rather than guessing. It catches the embedded-payload
shape, which is the high-signal one, and says plainly what it cannot yet see.

It is SUSPICIOUS-tier, never MALICIOUS. `--no-chm` disables it and
`--chm-threshold` tunes the score.

## Tradecraft

Asks what a file *does*. Every other pass is keyed to a known identity or to a
format's anatomy, and both are silent on a plain-text web shell, or on shellcode
pasted into a script as a byte array: such a file names no family and has no
structure to be odd about. On the lab corpus that gap was 0 % recall on web
shells, raw shellcode and tiny Metasploit ELFs (see
[Evaluation](evaluation.md#the-lab-corpus)).

**Script vectors** read text, in any language they recognise by content, and name
behaviour rather than a project:

| Family | Classes | Fires on |
|---|---|---|
| Web shells (T1505.003) | `tradecraft.webshell.*` | a request parameter reaching an exec sink in PHP (directly, concatenated into the command, or followed through assignments by a small taint walk), ASP, ASP.NET, JSP, ColdFusion and CGI; PHP evaluating a decoded string; a request parameter that is parsed as a URL (or whose upstream headers are replayed), fetched and streamed back, in PHP or through an ASP XMLHTTP object, followed by the same taint walk: a proxy into the server's network. A page that reads a file the request named is not that, and an admin panel's file editor stays quiet. A request parameter choosing the name the page resolves (6) and a page that answers only a hard-coded list of client addresses (4) corroborate and convict together. `$_SERVER` counts as request input only for the entries a client sets (`HTTP_*`, the query string, the path, the remote address), not for `argv` or `DOCUMENT_ROOT` |
| Network shells (T1059) | `tradecraft.netshell.*` | a socket wired to an interpreter in shell, PHP, Python, Perl, Java, Ruby, Lua and PowerShell; relay tools (`nc`/`ncat`/`socat` with `EXEC:` or `SYSTEM:`, `openssl s_client`, BusyBox `telnetd`, `awk`'s `/inet`); a Python stager executing what it reads from a socket |
| Unix breakouts (T1059.004, T1548.001, T1548.003) | `tradecraft.gtfobins.*` | [GTFOBins](https://gtfobins.github.io) escapes: a utility driven to spawn an interactive shell (editor/pager bang-escape, `pty.spawn`, `nmap --interactive`, `awk 'BEGIN{system}'`, `gdb -ex '!sh'`); the same under `sudo` (privilege escalation); a setuid breakout (`sh -p`, or the setuid bit set on a shell). The escape syntax is the signal, so a plain `find -exec rm` or `sudo sh -c` stays quiet |
| In-memory execution (T1620) | `tradecraft.memory.*` | scripts allocating memory through native APIs and starting a thread in it, loading a .NET assembly from decoded bytes, or reaching native APIs by reflection |
| Living off the land (T1218, T1105, T1003, T1490, T1574, T1562.001) | `tradecraft.lolbin.*`, `tradecraft.script.environment-hijack`, `tradecraft.script.security-driver-unloaded` | a [LOLBAS](https://lolbas-project.github.io) system binary fetching a remote payload, proxying execution through a script handler, dumping credential stores (or the `NTDS.dit` directory database) or destroying recovery; a signed Windows binary with no business being handed a URL fetching one (a browser, an Office program or a Squirrel updater handed a URL is doing its job, and only corroborates); a system binary copying a file from a share addressed by number; a program run straight from a file share (5: logon scripts do it); the environment variable that says where Windows or its shell is found redirected before a program is run; a minifilter driver unloaded by name (6: a product's own uninstaller does it). A binary's name proves nothing, so `regsvr32 /s foo.dll` stays quiet while `/i:` with a remote scriptlet does not. The set spans `certutil`/`bitsadmin`/`certreq`/`GfxDownloadWrapper`/`ms-appinstaller` download, `rundll32`/`regsvr32`/`mshta`/`Microsoft.Workflow.Compiler`/`AgentExecutor`/`Register-CimProvider` proxy execution, and the credential/recovery tools |

| Command channels (T1102) | `tradecraft.script.third-party-channel` | a script names a webhook (Discord/Telegram/Slack/Teams/Google Chat/DingTalk/Feishu/WeChat/Make/Zapier/IFTTT/Zulip/Webex/PagerDuty/Flock/Pushover/LINE Notify/ntfy/Healthchecks/n8n/ServerChan/PushPlus/…), a reverse tunnel (ngrok family/Cloudflare tunnels/localhost.run/serveo/localtunnel/dev tunnels/Tailscale/qsocket/ShellHub/tmate/pinggy/bore/packetriot/loophole/expose/sharedwithexpose/pitunnel/staqlab/telebit/…), a paste/file drop (pastebin raw/0x0.st/file.io/transfer.sh/catbox/anonfiles-class/…), an out-of-band interaction host (interact.sh/oast/burpcollaborator/dnslog/requestbin/…), a trusted-SaaS C2 cover from [LOLC2](https://lolc2.github.io) and [LOLFSaaS](https://lolfsaas.github.io) (Microsoft Graph, Google Drive/Sheets/Slides/Calendar/Translate, Dropbox, OneDrive, Firebase, Azure Functions, Cloudflare Workers/Pages, AWS Lambda, S3, Telegram bots, Discord CDN, Slack API, GitHub/GitLab/Bitbucket Contents/Gists, Reddit, Twitter/X, Mastodon, Spotify, SoundCloud, chess.com, lichess, OpenAI/Anthropic, blockchain RPC and explorers, …). Corroborating only |
| SaaS C2 API abuse (T1102) | `tradecraft.c2service.saas-api-call` | a specific abusable path on a trusted host — `graph.microsoft.com/v1.0/me/sendMail`, firebaseio realtime-DB writes, Dropbox content upload, Google Apps Script `/macros/s/*/exec`, Cloudflare `workers.dev` / `pages.dev`, AWS Lambda invoke, SharePoint drive item write, Teams channel message POST. Higher signal than naming the host, because no browser hits these programmatically |
| Detection bypasses (T1620, T1036.005, T1574.006, T1556.003, T1543.002, T1070.004, T1102.002, T1095, T1071.004, T1001.003, T1090.004) | `tradecraft.bypass.*` | the evasion primitives catalogued in [ArcticFox's bypass doc](https://github.com/s-b-repo/arcticfox-c3/blob/main/docs/Detection-Bypasses.md): `memfd_create` paired with `execveat`/`fexecve`/`/proc/self/fd` exec (anonymous in-memory binary), `prctl(PR_SET_NAME)` near a socket/exec (kernel-level process-name camouflage), writing `/etc/ld.so.preload` or resolving through `dlsym(RTLD_NEXT)` (shared-library shim), adding `pam_exec.so` to a PAM stack or replacing `pam_unix.so` (authentication-stack backdoor), `systemctl edit --full` or a `.service.d/override.conf` drop-in on a real unit (systemd unit hijack), unlinking `/proc/self/exe` (self-delete), fetching a GitHub README from the Contents / raw API with cache-busting params (dead-drop channel), a raw `IPPROTO_ICMP` socket paired with payload encode/decode (ICMP C2), `dns.resolver.resolve(..., 'TXT')` + `base64_decode` (DNS TXT C2), an open-redirect URL carrying zero-width codepoints (redirect heartbeat), a TLS `ServerName` that disagrees with the HTTP `Host` (domain fronting) |
| Script tradecraft | `tradecraft.script.*` | AMSI tampering, download-and-execute, decode-and-execute, DCOM and `xp_cmdshell` execution, Group Policy password hunting, keyboard capture, token theft, disabling defences and the weaker signals below |
| Windows script tradecraft that convicts alone | `tradecraft.script.*` | behaviour with no ordinary use, each scored 8: the name of the command assembled from characters of unrelated strings (`$env:ComSpec[4,24,25]-join''`, a variable found by wildcard for its name, the call operator on glued fragments, reordered format strings in bulk) (T1027.010); a command carried in variables whose *names* are punctuation (`${;}`, `${=}`), where the shell's own `${(f)name}` does not match because the name has to be entirely punctuation (T1027.010); a script parsed into a syntax tree and rewritten, the tree types named one by one (T1027.010); PowerShell's logging state reached by reflection (T1562.002); a per-user handler planted where an auto-elevating binary reads it (T1548.002); a WMI event filter bound to a consumer that runs a command (T1546.003); a debugger set on a logon-screen accessibility program (T1546.008); a list of passwords walked against an authentication interface (T1110); a shell command file whose icon is on a remote share (T1187); a process-starting script posted to an application server's script console, or its JMX deployer invoked (T1190); a boot sector written to a physical drive (T1561.002); a binary rebuilt from text, written out and started (T1027.009) |
| Windows script tradecraft that corroborates | `tradecraft.script.*` | what an administrator's script also does, scored 3 to 6 so that two signals must agree: a mailbox rule created through Outlook (T1137.005); a password manager's key material located (T1555.005); an HTTP listener beside a minted certificate authority (T1557); a `netsh` port forward (T1090.001); an update uninstalled silently; a shortcut that starts an interpreter under another program's icon; a terminal profile's command line rewritten; the screen captured in a timed loop; a listener that also dials out. Starting a process under another account, validating a credential, importing a module tree and encrypting with a password are things every administration script does and are not classes at all |


A class scoring 8 or more is a verdict alone: the behaviour has no ordinary use.
Where a behaviour has several parts they must sit together — within a few
lines for a one-liner's shape, within one short script for the longer ones —
so a module that opens a socket in one function and names a shell in another
is not a shell wired to a socket.
Below 8 a class is something admin scripts also do, and two must agree:
credential-store access, token theft, remote execution, defence evasion and an
unprivileged shell breakout score 6, reflection, autostart, capture and raw
listening sockets score 4, timestomping, hidden windows, run-time command
building and naming a third-party command channel score 3. A `sudo` or setuid
breakout crosses the privilege boundary and so convicts alone.

**Payload bytes** look for what position-independent code has to do to run at all,
not for one tool's stub:

| Class | Evidence |
|---|---|
| `shellcode.peb-walk-api-hash` | the PEB -> Ldr -> module-list walk within 512 bytes of a rotate-and-add over a name: finding APIs with no import table |
| `shellcode.api-hash-constants` | two or more immediates equal to the ROR13 hash of a network or process API. The table is computed from the API names at start-up, so it is a statement about the hashing convention rather than a list of opaque numbers |
| `shellcode.fpu-getpc-decoder` | `fnstenv` GetPC, a pop, and an in-place xor |
| `shellcode.jmp-call-pop-decoder` | a jump to a call that lands back on a pop, with an xor in the body. The branch targets are followed, so reordered registers still match and a call landing elsewhere does not |
| `shellcode.linux-socket-syscalls`, `linux-execve-shell` | hand-loaded syscall numbers in a blob under 64 KiB; a large static binary legitimately contains syscall instructions |

**Carriers** connect the two. `0x` lists, VBA `&H` and decimal arrays, `\x` runs
split across string literals, and base64 (through gzip, zlib and UTF-16) are
decoded and analysed again, up to four layers on a shared 16 MiB budget. A class
counts once however many layers show it.

Nothing decoded is ever executed. It is SUSPICIOUS-tier, never MALICIOUS, so a
hit alone does not trigger `--quarantine` at its default level. `--no-tradecraft`
disables it and `--tradecraft-threshold` tunes the score.

## Host behaviour (the sensor's own inventories)

The file detectors answer "is this file malicious". The behaviour layer answers
a different question: is something on this host arranging for the next file to
be missed? It runs in the resident agent (`cau defend`), read-only, and reports
state rather than proof — a host administrator may legitimately install any of
these, so every class sits below the response threshold and corroborates rather
than convicts.

| Class | Novel | What it reads |
|---|---|---|
| `behavior.audit-library` | NOVEL-007 | a process whose environment loads `LD_AUDIT` or `LD_PRELOAD` from a library **no package owns**. A distribution package that ships an auditor is ordinary software, and the package database is what says so |
| `behavior.fanotify-listener` | NOVEL-008 | a process holding a fanotify file descriptor (the kernel describes it in `fdinfo`) that no package owns: a watcher on the filesystem |
| `behavior.fanotify-ignored-mask` | NOVEL-008 | the same listener asking **not** to be told about some events. An ignored mask is the suppression primitive, so it scores above the listener itself |
| `behavior.systemd-generator` | NOVEL-009 | a unit under `/run/systemd/generator` that no package owns: it adds itself at every boot |
| `behavior.bpf-program` | NOVEL-010 | a pinned object under `/sys/fs/bpf` that no package owns: a program loaded into the kernel |

The benign anchor is the package database, and it is reported: with no package
database there is no anchor, so the inventories are published without one and
the layer says so rather than presenting them as clean. A surface that is
*absent* (no generator directory, no bpffs root) is not a finding; a surface
that exists and cannot be read is noted, because that is a permission problem
and not an absence.

## Fusion

Each detector's threshold is tuned so that it alone stays quiet on ordinary
software. The cost is that a file scoring 5/7 on the heuristics and 6/8 on
the structural pass used to be CLEAN although two detectors with uncorrelated
error modes both saw something. `scanner/fusion` makes that corroboration
count:

1. Every scored source becomes a **ratio** score/threshold, capped at 1.5 so
   one loud detector is still one detector.
2. The strongest source is **primary** and counts in full. Every other source
   at or above **0.4** of its own threshold is **corroborating** and counts at
   **0.5** × ratio. Weaker evidence (one `Sleep` import) is listed as
   below-floor and does not count.
3. The fused score reaches **1.0** when a detector crosses alone, exactly as
   before, or when corroboration adds up to the same thing. Two sources at
   0.7 of their thresholds fuse to 1.05 and alert; one at 0.9 and one at 0.2
   fuse to 0.9 and do not.
4. A hash or YARA hit is **definitive**: it is never downgraded, and next to
   it a scored source either corroborates (at or above the floor) or does
   not.

The verdict carries a tier (`clean`, `observed`, `suspicious`, `malicious`),
the fused score, a confidence (`low`, `medium`, `high`), the sources that
agreed strongest first, the union of their ATT&CK and NOVEL ids, every source
with its role (`definitive`, `primary`, `corroborating`, `below-floor`,
`silent`, `skipped`) and evidence, a one-line explanation, and a
`corroborated` flag that is set when the suspicious tier was reached only
through the lattice. Those are the detections fusion adds; they are what the
`fusion` eval detector, the `fusion/corroborated` SARIF rule and the
"Fused-only detections" summary line count. Fuzzy-hash matches are their own
`similarity` source, separate from the structural score.

On top of that independent weighted sum sits a **conditional chaining** layer —
the dependent half of the hybrid lattice. The weighted sum treats sources as
independent votes and cannot express that two findings on the same file
*reinforce* each other: a packed image that also carries process-injection
capability is not the sum of two observations, it is a recognisable attack path;
a document vector that also carries an encoded executable is a dropper. A
**chain** is a set of predicates that must each bind to a *distinct* counted
source; when they all match, the chain adds a small bounded bonus and records
itself so the verdict can name the path it saw. The shipped set is deliberately
small and every rule needs two independent detectors:

| Chain | Fires when | Technique |
|---|---|---|
| `packed-and-injects` | the static pass names a packer **and** the heuristics see process injection | T1055 |
| `document-dropper` | an OLE/PDF/LNK/ISO vector **and** an encoded executable | T1027.009 |
| `peel-revealed` | an obfuscation layer (peeler/encchain) **and** a behavioural detector flagging the revealed content | T1027 |

Chaining only ever **adds**, so the lattice stays monotone, and the total bonus
is capped (0.75, no more than one corroborating source), so no amount of chaining
can run away from the evidence. Chains build only on sources that already count —
never a way to resurrect evidence the lattice discarded below the floor. The
default engine verdict uses this hybrid (`fusion.FuseChained`); the flat weighted
sum (`fusion.Fuse`) remains available to library callers.

The lattice never creates evidence: a file silent on every detector stays
clean, and raising any input never lowers the fused score or tier (a
randomized test pins this). Measured on the 349 files of the Kali Windows tool
set: zero fused-only detections and zero new false positives; the nearest
benign file (the UPX-packed `wget.exe`, static 7/8) has no second source
above the floor.

## Firmware (a separate command)

Firmware is not part of the per-file `cau scan` — it has its own command,
`cau firmware`, because a BIOS image is a different kind of subject and its
findings do not join the file-scan fusion lattice. `scanner/uefi` parses a UEFI
image's Firmware Volumes and FFS files/sections and reports a module inventory,
the FV header's checksum integrity, and any module GUID on an operator-supplied
implant blocklist.

It is deliberately conservative: the engine ships **no implant truth set**
(firmware is overwhelmingly legitimate PEI/DXE/SMM drivers, so scoring module
shapes would be a false-positive machine), so only known evidence scores —
`uefi.volume-checksum-invalid` (a tampered or hand-built FV header, weight 3)
and `uefi.known-implant-guid` (a `--implants` blocklist match, weight 8,
T1542.001). `uefi.module-rule-match` runs every module's executable body through
the YARA rules. Everything else is inventory. An in-tree, bounded LZMA decoder opens
the compressed sections modern images keep their driver volumes in, and nested
volumes are walked. Module bodies are not disassembled, and NVRAM, signatures and
boot policy are not analysed. The boot chain of a live host is
[`cau boot-scan`](cli.md#cau-boot-scan). See [the CLI reference](cli.md#cau-firmware).
