# Limitations

Every detector has a failure mode, and this engine is built so that each one
is stated rather than hidden. The planned evasion suite (PLAN.md, Phase 6)
will demonstrate all of them against this engine; the evaluation harness
exists so the demonstration can be measured.

## By detector

| Detector | Dies to | Survives |
|---|---|---|
| Hash signatures | a single flipped byte | nothing short of an identical file |
| Fuzzy hashes (TLSH, ssdeep, imphash, telfhash) | a repack, a rebuild, a changed import or symbol set | trivial edits and appended data |
| YARA | an author who knows the ruleset: renamed strings, encrypted payloads, split patterns | content the rule author described |
| Heuristics | capability hidden behind dynamic API resolution or encryption; and the inverse: a debugger has an injector's import profile and is reported as one | binaries that still name what they do |
| Static structure | an unpacked, unsigned, plainly linked credential dumper looks ordinary; a packed benign tool looks packed; on ELF, a preload library that reaches libc through raw syscalls while also importing nothing else suspicious, or a loader stub that keeps a system interpreter path and a normal section table; on Mach-O, an unsigned command-line tool (signing is a launch-time check, not a file one) and FairPlay encryption that is indistinguishable in the header from a protector | tampered headers, forged signatures, loader-only import tables, appended payloads; on ELF, RWX or packed segments, stripped section tables, non-system interpreters, writable `RPATH`, libc interposers (whether they resolve originals through `dlsym` **or** reach the kernel through raw syscalls), constructor pointers (`.init_array`) resolved outside executable code, unsigned or `modinfo`-less kernel modules; on Mach-O, RWX segments, encrypted load regions, entry points outside every segment, dylibs loaded from attacker-writable paths, executable-stack flags |
| Tradecraft | a payload encrypted under a key the file does not carry in a recognised form; a decoder that avoids GetPC idioms; API hashing that is not a rotate; UPX-packed binaries, which are not unpacked; behaviour split across files, so a module loader or helper alone is silent; languages outside the vectors. Heldout misses are concentrated in PowerShell (50.3 %) and web shells (41.2 %) | web shells, network shells, in-memory loaders and shellcode, in the clear or through hex, decimal, `\\x`, base64, gzip, zlib and UTF-16 carriers, whatever the tool is called |
| Invisible codepoints | a channel that uses visible characters, or lives in a binary format | any invisible codepoint in text or code, regardless of density |
| Fusion | a file silent on every detector | the attacker who beats one detector and leaves evidence on another — and, through conditional chaining, the attacker whose findings line up along a recognised attack path even when no single detector crosses its own floor |

## Documented false-positive classes

| Detector | Class | Measured |
|---|---|---|
| Heuristics | debuggers and injection-capable developer tools (OllyDbg scores 11); on Linux, `sudo` imports `ptrace` and the `process_vm_*` pair for its intercept feature and scores 6 | 28 of 349 files in the Kali Windows tool set score at or above 7, almost all of them offensive tools shipped on purpose; 1 of 4,729 ELF files gains a heuristic detection from its import table and that one is a Kali-shipped offensive tool |
| Static (PE) | none above the threshold on the tool set; packed benign tools render as low suspicion with the packer named | `wget.exe` 7/8, `klogger.exe` 6/8 |
| Static (ELF) | launcher stubs with three or fewer substantive imports (`node`, `gvpr`, `selinuxenabled`); vendor executable sections with non-compiler names (libGL `wtext`, absl `malloc_hook`); one old build with an executable stack; one archiver with an appended data block. Sanitizer runtimes, `libeatmydata` and sudo's noexec shims are named as known libc interposers and not scored | 21 of 4,999 ELF files under Kali's `/usr/bin`, `/usr/sbin`, `/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu`, `/usr/libexec` and `/usr/lib/systemd` carry one weight-1 observation; 0 reach the threshold; 40 of 40 signed kernel modules score 0; a UPX-packed `ls` scores 6/8 |
| Static (ELF, deep resolution) | the relocation-resolved `.init_array`, symbol-version and raw-syscall-interposer rules add information, not weight, on ordinary software: a normal PIE's constructors resolve into `.text`, a libc build is named as a known interposer, and symbol versions are informational | no benign ELF in the local test corpus crosses the threshold from these rules; a full re-measurement against the 4,999-file set is pending (it is the same open item as every number here) |
| Static (Mach-O) | measurement pending — the Mach-O pass is new and no macOS corpus has been scanned on the development host. `unsigned` and `signature-unverified` are informational (weight 0), and `encrypted` is weight-1 with the FairPlay-vs-protector ambiguity stated in its detail | 0 measured; a macOS package-set scan is required before a field number can be published |
| Stego | a stray ZERO WIDTH SPACE pasted into documentation or a translation file; source files that enumerate Unicode categories (regular-expression libraries, identifier tables); a stray byte-order mark mid-file | 69 of 70,200 benign text artifacts (0.10 %) |
| Fusion | none observed; the conditional chains each require two independent detectors, so a chain's false-positive surface is the intersection of two error modes, not their union | 0 fused-only detections on the tool set; chain rules measured against the same set show no benign tool escalated by a chain alone |
| Tradecraft | documentation and example scripts that really are shells (`socat`, WireGuard and netcat examples under `/usr/share/doc`); offensive tools' own package files. GTFOBins shapes stay quiet on plain `sudo sh -c`, `ssh -p 22`, `chmod 4755` and `find -exec sh -c`, because the vectors require the breakout-specific escape syntax. The SaaS-C2 host class scores 3 (corroborating only), so a legitimate Microsoft Graph / Firebase / OpenAI / Anthropic integration never crosses threshold on the host alone; the abusable-path class (score 5) needs a second finding or a verbose file to detect. The bypass pass requires a pairing, so `memfd_create` for shared memory, `prctl(PR_SET_NAME)` in a Go binary, a `dns.resolver` TXT read for SPF and an integrity checker reading `/etc/ld.so.preload` all stay quiet. The newly added classes are the same kind of narrow: the command-assembly class needs its parts to sit within one window of each other, so a logger that truncates a line with `Substring(0, …)` and a syntax-tree walk in another library do not convict a file between them; the punctuation-variable class needs the name to be *entirely* punctuation, so the shell's own `${(f)name}` stays quiet; the web-shell classes need the request to reach the sink, so a page that reads a form field stays quiet; the living-off-the-land classes need the binary named as an executable, so a changelog's "Update" beside a link stays quiet. The Windows script classes are measured on 7,686 scripts from eighteen public administration repositories (PowerShell itself, Pester, dbatools, CSS-Exchange, Chocolatey packages, DSC resources and others): 7 false verdicts, and 63 for the first version of the content, which gave every shape eight points | 4 of 24,999 benign files in the wide sweep, all genuine offensive material shipped by Kali packages; 4 of 2,398 in heldout, not inspected by rule. `make eval` on the shipped corpus: FPs 0 → 0 after the GTFOBins, LOLBAS, LOLC2, LOLFSaaS and ArcticFox-bypass expansions |
| Encoded executable | embedded encoded binaries in security tooling and exploit docs (impacket, lsassy, nxc, metasploit) — genuine encoded executables, flagged as designed | 26 of 139,860 benign files (0.019 %) |
| Obfuscation-chain peeler | exploit module documentation that carries its own payload — Metasploit RCE modules with carve chains, the `lsassy` and `nxc` embedded dumps; genuine payloads, flagged as designed | 10 of 130,673 benign files (0.0077 %) |

## The network plane

The sensor reads the kernel's socket tables rather than the wire, which is what
gives every finding a process and a file to act on. The cost of that choice:

| Limitation | Why | What it means |
|---|---|---|
| No payload, ever | `/proc` carries metadata, not bytes | no protocol inspection, no JA3/JA4 or TLS fingerprinting, no content signatures on traffic. A C2 channel inside ordinary HTTPS to an unlisted address is invisible to this plane |
| A sample, not a stream | each scan is a point-in-time read | a connection that opens and closes between two samples is never seen. A beacon with a 5-second check-in and a 30-second interval will be caught only by luck. `cau net --interval` and `cau defend` narrow the window; they do not close it |
| No byte counts | `/proc/net/*` queue columns are instantaneous, not cumulative | volumetric exfiltration is not detected on this plane at all |
| Attribution needs privilege | `/proc/<pid>/fd` is readable by the owner and root | without root most sockets are reported as unattributed. They are still scored and still counted; nothing is guessed. Measured on a stock desktop: 40 of 48 sockets attributed as root, against 13 of 33 as an ordinary user. This is not only a visibility difference — an unattributed socket has no executable to group by, so several weak signals about one daemon never meet, and an unprivileged run is therefore **quieter than it should be** rather than merely less informative. The one real false positive this sensor has had was invisible until it was read as root |
| A kernel rootkit can lie | the socket tables are the kernel's own answer | a hidden socket is hidden from this sensor too. That is what `cau-kernel`'s integrity checks are for |
| Beaconing confuses schedulers with implants | both check in regularly | a binary a package installed scores 3 for a cadence, not 6, so update agents and time sync corroborate rather than alert. A jittered implant above 25 % relative spread is missed on purpose: below that, a person's browsing is indistinguishable from a schedule |
| One host cannot verify a fabric | ARP and gateway state is this host's view | a MAC that moved is reported and never treated as live state; a router failover and a VRRP pair look the same from here. Fleet corroboration (several hosts seeing one MAC claim the gateway) is not implemented |
| No ATT&CK row for resolver tampering | no sub-technique covers it | `netscan.resolver.unexpected` ships unmapped rather than mapped to something adjacent, so the coverage matrix is not padded |
| The public-resolver allowlist is a list | it names Google, Cloudflare, Quad9, OpenDNS, Control D and AdGuard | a host pointed at some other public resolver on purpose will produce one finding of score 5 until the operator's own resolver is a local address or the class is suppressed by threshold |
| Blocking is not containment | a drop rule is visible to the peer | a peer with a second address is back at once, and an implant that resolves a new one is unaffected. `--sever` closes the sockets already open; together they buy minutes, not safety |
| A block needs a firewall | nftables or iptables, and the privilege to use them | a host with neither is told at startup, and the rest of the defence still runs. iptables has no element timeouts, so expiry there depends on a later `Expire()` pass reading the rule comments — a host that never runs one again keeps the block until `cau net clear` |

## Cross-domain intake

`--ingest` is a trust decision, and the engine makes its side of it explicit:

- Whatever writes those files is trusted to the extent that it can raise an
  incident on this host and, through the watchlist, make a quiet connection
  worth reporting. It cannot stop a process, quarantine a file or block an
  address on its own: `correlate.PlanFor` discards every signal that carries a
  host name, so remote evidence only ever corroborates something local.
- There is no authentication, no transport and no schema validation beyond
  parsing. The files are read from a path an operator chose; securing that path
  — who may write to it, and how the telemetry got there — is outside this
  package.
- Reading is append-only and bounded: 8 MiB and 4096 events per pass per file,
  oldest dropped past 4096 held signals. A sensor writing endlessly costs memory
  it cannot exceed, never detection.
- A claim expires. An identification is a statement about an address at a
  moment, and addresses are reassigned, so remote evidence is stamped with when
  this host took it in and dropped past `--ingest-max-age` (24 hours by
  default) — on ingest, and again whenever the watchlist is read, because a
  sensor that stopped writing produces no ingest pass to prune on. Without that,
  a month-old claim about an address that has since been reassigned would still
  confirm an incident and license a block. `--ingest-max-age 0` keeps
  everything, and the size cap still applies.
- A named pipe cannot wedge the layer. Telemetry is opened through
  `internal/safefs`: `O_NONBLOCK`, then ask the open descriptor, then refuse
  anything but a regular file. An ingest directory is somewhere an operator
  points at another program's output, so a FIFO is a plausible thing to find
  there, and a blocking open would hang the ingest layer, then shutdown, then
  `--once` outright, because that layer runs first.
- A host that names itself is believed. Two sensors claiming the same host name
  are indistinguishable here.

## Correlation and response

`cau defend` is only as good as its links. It joins signals on a file path or a
PID, so an implant that runs from a system path links to nothing, because system
paths never link. Network signals add the peer address as a third key, which is
what joins two hosts' views of one C2 server — and what means two unrelated
processes talking to the same busy address are reported as one incident. A process flagged only by argv needs a second layer, so an
attacker who leaves no other evidence stays an alert for a human. A cycle is a
sample: anything that starts and exits between two passes is seen only by the
kernel guard, and only if it runs. inotify reports changes after they happen, so a
dropped file can run before the scan finishes. Refusing that first run takes the
kernel file guard, and only for a file already flagged. A `/proc` view can be
tampered with by a kernel rootkit, which `cau-kernel`'s integrity checks exist for.

## Integrity and tamper resistance

The agent is installed once and left running, so what it does is decided by
files rather than by somebody at a terminal. `cau selftest --record` baselines
the signature DB, the YARA rules, the fuzzy DB, the threat feed, `cau.conf` and
the agent binary, and signs a pin for the SIEM address. Each file is then
checked for how it sits on disk and against that baseline, the feed on every
reload. What that does **not** buy:

Several things that were limitations here are now closed, and are described with
the rest of the behaviour under `cau defend` and `cau selftest` in the
[CLI reference](cli.md) rather than left as caveats here:
an unsigned baseline no longer silently satisfies a build that pins a key; a
signing key left on the host is detected and reported; the CA bundle that
decides who may answer at the SIEM address is baselined alongside the address
itself; an override from a flag or the environment still wins but is raised as
`defend.weak.siem-pin-overridden`; and TLS verification turned off is raised as
`defend.weak.siem-tls-unverified`; the signing key can be linked into a build
you compiled yourself (`make build SELFTEST_PUBKEY=…`), not only into a release;
and `siem-cert-pin` pins the manager's public key, so a certificate from any CA
the host happens to trust is no longer enough to receive incidents. What follows
is what remains true after all of that.

| Limitation | Why | What it means |
|---|---|---|
| Root can do all of it anyway | every check here runs as a userspace process reading files root owns | against an attacker who already has root these checks are tamper-*evident*, not tamper-proof: they can patch the running binary's memory, replace the binary along with the key pinned into it, or just stop the unit. Nothing in userspace fixes this, and a document that claimed otherwise would be the most dangerous page in this repository. What raises the cost is the signed baseline, the key being elsewhere, `cau-kernel`'s guards and a SIEM that notices the agent went quiet — not these digests |
| Verified delivery still rests on a trusted CA, unless pinned | the agent is an HTTPS client | `siem-cert-pin` closes this: the manager's public key must match, in addition to the chain verifying, so a certificate from any of the CAs in the host's trust store is no longer enough. Set it and the residual limit is only that `--wazuh-insecure` can still disable verification entirely — reported, but permitted, because lab managers with self-signed certificates exist. Leave it unset and the old limit stands in full |
| Drift says what changed, not who changed it | a digest comparison has no actor | *when* is recorded — every drift is a timestamped incident in `/var/log/cau/defend.jsonl` — but attributing it to a user or a process needs the kernel's own audit trail, which this agent does not read. It also cannot distinguish an operator's legitimate `cau feed update` from an attacker's rewrite by inspection, which is why a legitimate change means re-recording and why every drift is reported rather than judged |
| A failed check never stops the agent | refusing to run on a bad digest would be a one-file off switch for the defence | a tampered resource is refused and the last trustworthy value stays live. An attacker can therefore freeze the intel layer at its last good state, loudly. This one is a **deliberate trade, not an oversight**: the alternative hands anyone who can corrupt a single file the ability to disable the whole defence, which is a worse outcome than running on content one revision stale. It is listed here because it is a real consequence, not because it should be changed |
| Surviving a broken file costs what that file gave | the agent keeps running rather than refusing, so the broken file's job goes undone until it is repaired | with the signature database broken there is no hash detection; with the key or baseline broken no pin is enforced, so the SIEM address comes from `cau.conf`; with `cau.conf` broken the built-in defaults apply, and those act, so a host that depends on report-only should set `--report-only` on the command line. Each case raises a top-score `defend.tamper.*` incident, and the daemon stays up. |
| An override is reported, not prevented | a flag or an environment variable comes from whoever started the process | `--siem` and `$CAU_SIEM` still take precedence over the pinned address, deliberately: an operator moving their SIEM must not need a re-recorded baseline before the agent will talk to it. Anyone who can edit the unit file or its `EnvironmentFile` can therefore still redirect the stream — they just cannot do it quietly any more |

## Obfuscation-chain peeler

- **It reverses, it does not crack.** Encodings and fixed substitutions are undone.
  Anything keyed is not, and that includes single-byte XOR.
- **A rot or Caesar layer is judged on its first 4 KiB,** so a rotated payload behind 4 KiB of
  filler that reveals nothing is missed. Text under 96 bytes tries every shift; longer
  text picks by letter frequency, which is a statistic and can be wrong on unusual
  input.
- **Whole-number bases stop at 64 KiB.** Base 36, 58 and 62 decode in quadratic time,
  so a longer blob in those alphabets is left alone.
- **Carving reads one run at a time.** A run needs 64 characters, the 64 longest in a
  file are tried, and a payload split into short strings and joined at run time is
  not reassembled.
- **The budget is a wall, not a horizon.** Past 512 nodes, 64 MiB, depth 32, six
  branches per node or 5 seconds a peel reports `peel.exhausted`. That is a finding,
  and what lay beyond it stays unseen.
- **The false-positive number comes from a Kali host.** Over 130,673 benign files it
  flagged 10, all real payloads in offensive tooling. It has not been measured on an
  ordinary host. Rotation and carving add time: that set took 71 s against 44 s
  before, about 0.2 ms more on a small text file.

## Detection robustness (measured)

`scanner/robustness_test.go` measures how much benign, structure-level
perturbation each string/import detector survives on synthetic fixtures — the
defensive form of "evasion distance". It is a regression gate: a bundled rule
that becomes brittle (a benign transform drops a detection that fired on the
untouched sample) fails the test.

| Transform | YARA / heuristics | Why |
|---|---|---|
| case fold (upper/lower) | **survives** | rules carry `nocase`; the harness surfaced two case-sensitivity gaps that review had missed — the whole wannacry rule, and the ransomware rule's extension strings (`.locked`, `.encrypted`, `.crypt`), both `ascii wide` without `nocase` so a `.LOCKED` note walked past them — and both were fixed by adding `nocase` |
| UTF-16 widening, NUL-infixing | **survives** | the `ascii wide` modifier matches the widened form, so NUL-between-bytes is just UTF-16LE |
| prefix / suffix junk | **survives** | the indicator strings are still present and contiguous |
| base64 of the whole file | **evades the byte-pattern match** | the contiguous byte sequence is gone; this is the documented encoding gap for raw YARA/heuristics, and it is why the engine also runs the encoded-executable pass and the bounded peeler |

The base64/encryption gap is fundamental to byte-pattern matching and is why
the engine fuses several detectors rather than trusting any one. Peeling
encoded layers is no longer only planned: the encoded-executable pass
(`scanner/encchain`) recovers embedded base64/hex executables, the bounded
peeler (`internal/peeler`, NOVEL-012) unwraps an obfuscation tree, and the
fusion lattice's `peel-revealed` chain feeds a peeled layer that a behavioural
detector then flagged back into the verdict. What remains planned is the
emulation fallback for layers the bounded peeler cannot reach. The robustness
harness runs on synthetic samples only and ships no bypass.

The stego pass is presence-based on purpose: a single pasted codepoint is
reported as exactly one occurrence with no payload run, so an analyst can
tell it from an encoded channel at a glance, and `--stego-threshold 8` makes
the engine require a payload run or an ASCII carrier as well.

## Scoring: weighted fusion plus conditional chaining

The fusion lattice (`scanner/fusion`) combines the detectors two ways. The base
is an independent weighted sum: each source is normalised to a ratio against its
own threshold, the strongest counts in full and the rest corroborate at a
fraction, so evidence that is below every individual floor can still cross the
fused bar. On top of that, a small set of **conditional chains** states
attack paths — a packed image that also carries injection capability, a document
or container that also carries an encoded executable, an obfuscation layer
peeled away to reveal content a behavioural detector flagged. A chain adds a
bounded, capped bonus only when two or more *distinct* counted sources match it,
so it expresses that findings on one file reinforce each other without letting
any single detector masquerade as a path. The chaining is monotone — it only
ever raises a verdict — never downgrades a definitive hash or YARA hit, and the
flat weighted sum is preserved unchanged so the measured false-positive baseline
keeps its meaning. The limits of the chain set are the limits of any tuned
content: the three shipped chains were fixed against the same fixtures as the
numeric parameters, and the field-false-positive caveat below applies to them
too.

## What is not covered yet

- **The offensive-PowerShell classes that are one capability and have an
  ordinary use.** The scoring rule is that a class of 8 or more convicts alone
  and anything weaker needs a second finding. A script that takes a screenshot
  once (4), rewrites a file's timestamps (3), forwards a port (5), removes an
  update quietly (5) or starts a process under another account (0) is doing
  something an administrator also does, so those files stay below the
  threshold and the corpus counts them as misses. A toolkit's *loader* scores
  nothing at all: `Get-ChildItem` over a tree piped to `Import-Module` or
  dot-sourced is how every PowerShell module loads itself, and the loader is
  not the attack, the modules it loads are. The held-out offensive PowerShell
  class is therefore measured at **95 of 181 (52.5 %)** and the remainder
  is mostly this shape, not a missing rule. Giving each such script a class
  of its own worth eight points was tried and measured: it took the dev
  split's PowerShell class from 78 to 94 of 102, left the held-out one at
  95 of 181, and convicted 63 of 7,686 public administration scripts
  where 7 are convicted now. The two obfuscation shapes that are not "a
  command assembled from unrelated strings" — a command in variables whose
  names are punctuation, and a script parsed into a syntax tree and rewritten
  — are kept as eight-point classes of their own, because neither has an
  ordinary use and both are tight: the shell's own `${(f)name}` does not match
  the first, and the syntax-tree namespace is in no administration script.
- **Packed tools that reach the credential stores through ordinary libraries.**
  A packer keeps the import table, and with it the library list *and* the
  function names — the loader needs the names to rebuild the address table.
  A packed credential dumper is therefore reported from the credential stores'
  own libraries (`samlib`, `cryptdll`, `vaultcli`) or from a credential-store
  API that survived in the function list. What is still not caught is one
  that reaches the same stores through `advapi32`, `mpr` and `netapi32`, which
  is what every file manager and every Qt program links, and two of the three
  packed dumpers in the dev split are of that kind: they are reported as
  packed and nothing more. Reading those imports would convict packed
  installers, so the rule does not. A packer that destroys the import table
  outright and resolves the functions by hash at run time is not read at all.
- **The LOLBAS catalogue's single-binary invocations.** `msbuild.exe
  project.proj`, `dotnet.exe library.dll`, `mofcomp.exe file.mof` and
  `fsi.exe script.fsscript` are documented abuse paths, and each is also what
  a developer, a build and an administrator type. The catalogue corpus is
  therefore measured at **128 of 408 (31.4 %)**, and the remaining misses are
  dominated by these: a rule that convicted them would convict the build
  system too.
- **Web-shell toolkit components.** A toolkit's IP-allow-list gate scores 4 and
  its menu page scores 0, because neither has a capability of its own — the
  gate exists to hide the pages that do. Detecting them would mean detecting
  the *project's* name, which the content rules refuse to do.

- **File formats.** The structural pass parses PE, ELF (32- and 64-bit, both
  byte orders; executables, shared objects, relocatable objects and kernel
  modules) and Mach-O (thin and universal/fat, 32- and 64-bit, both byte
  orders). Dedicated passes also cover OLE / VBA, PDF, Shell Links (LNK),
  ISO 9660 containers, compressed archives (ZIP / TAR / gzip and tar.gz),
  Compiled HTML Help (CHM) and UEFI firmware (`cau firmware`: Firmware-Volume
  and FFS enumeration). Every other container — Mach-O fat embeds aside — falls
  back to hashing, YARA, heuristic strings, entropy, fuzzy digests and the stego
  pass only.
- **Archives and CHM, what the passes do not do.** The archive pass enumerates
  members and scores container hygiene (decompression-bomb ratio/absolute caps,
  Zip-Slip path traversal, lure double-extensions, single-executable and
  encrypted/script/nested members) from the central directory and bounded
  member peeks; it does not recursively scan each member's content through the
  full engine, and it reads a member's magic from at most a few hundred
  decompressed bytes. The CHM pass enumerates the ITSF/ITSP/PMGL directory and
  scores embedded executables, shortcuts and dangerous scripts by member name;
  the LZX-compressed content section is not decompressed, so HTML/script bodies
  and the `<OBJECT>` shortcut/WinExec tradecraft inside them are not inspected
  in v1 (it says "present but not inspected" rather than guessing). Plain `.js`
  inside a CHM is deliberately not scored — help-file navigation uses it
  legitimately.
- **Firmware, what the pass does not do.** The UEFI pass (`cau firmware`, its
  own workflow rather than part of the per-file scan) walks Firmware Volumes and
  the FFS files and sections inside them and reports a module inventory, the FV
  header's 16-bit-checksum integrity, and any module GUID matching an
  operator-supplied implant blocklist. It ships **no implant truth set**:
  firmware is overwhelmingly legitimate PEI/DXE/SMM drivers, so scoring module
  shapes would be a false-positive machine, and the only scored signals are a
  checksum failure (a genuine tamper tell), a blocklist match (empty by default,
  loaded with `--implants`) and a YARA rule matching a module body. Module bodies are inventoried, not
  disassembled; LZMA sections are opened and module bodies run through the YARA rules, but other compressed sections are not; the Intel flash
  descriptor's region layout is detected but not fully parsed; NVRAM, signatures
  and boot policy are not analysed. This is the Phase-8 wedge with a small-n
  truth set, stated as such rather than oversold.
- **ELF, what the pass does not do.** It reads headers, segments, sections, the
  dynamic table, symbols, versions (`.gnu.version_r` / `_d`), notes and
  `.modinfo`. It resolves `.init_array` and `.preinit_array` constructor
  pointers — directly for a non-PIE image, and through `R_*_RELATIVE`
  relocations for a PIE — and flags any that land outside executable code; it
  does not otherwise apply relocations. It computes telfhash (over the
  Trend Micro filtered symbol set) alongside the CAU import-set clustering key,
  but telfhash is empty for a symbol set below TLSH's 50-byte floor because this
  TLSH library has no `forcehash`. The libc-interposer rule now fires on a
  preload library whether it resolves the originals through `dlsym` or reaches
  the kernel through raw syscalls (x86-64, i386 and aarch64 opcodes are
  recognised; other architectures leave the syscall count at zero). A kernel
  module's appended signature is detected, never verified (the kernel keyring is
  not available to a file scanner, and the report says so).
- **Mach-O, what the pass does not do.** It reads the header, load commands,
  segments and sections, linked dylibs, `LC_RPATH`, the `LC_MAIN` /
  `LC_UNIXTHREAD` entry point, `LC_CODE_SIGNATURE` (presence only — the
  signature is not verified against a trust store) and `LC_ENCRYPTION_INFO`, and
  it enumerates imports and exports from `LC_SYMTAB`. It does not walk the
  `LC_DYLD_INFO` bind/export trie, so two-level-namespace bind targets beyond
  the classic symbol table are not resolved; code-signature contents (CDHash,
  entitlements, Team ID) are not parsed; and the FairPlay-vs-protector ambiguity
  of an encrypted load region cannot be resolved from the file alone.
- **Linux packages, what the pass does not do.** The package detector
  (`scanner/linuxpkg`) is detection-only and standard-library-only: it reads
  install-time scripts from the package structure but never installs, extracts
  to disk or executes anything. Because it is pure Go, members packed with xz or
  zstd (some `.deb` control tarballs, some Arch packages) and the SquashFS inside
  AppImage and Snap are not decompressed — it records an honest "present but not
  inspected" note rather than guessing, so a payload reachable only through those
  is out of reach for v1. It scores script *tradecraft*, not package identity: a
  benign maintainer script that legitimately does something unusual can score,
  and a malicious payload that avoids the scored patterns can score low.
  Threshold 8, SUSPICIOUS tier only.
- **Update rollback on a first install.** `cau update` refuses a bundle older than the
  one recorded in `<db>.manifest`, but with no record there is nothing to compare, so
  the first install takes the bundle it is given. Anyone who can write beside the
  database can edit the record, and could rewrite the database just as easily.
- **`cau persist` reads links by name.** A link at an audited path is judged by where
  it points and the target is never opened, so a link into a system tree is taken at
  face value. A root attacker can hide content there.
- **PID reuse.** `cau ps --respond` compares the start time, name and executable
  immediately before signalling. A window a few system calls wide remains.
- **32-bit builds.** CI releases 64-bit only. The parsers are tested as real 386
  binaries, but `debian/control` says `Architecture: any` and no 32-bit package is
  built or smoke-tested here.
- **Unpacking.** Packed samples are identified, and a bounded peeler plus the
  encoded-executable pass now unwrap obfuscation trees and embedded encoded
  binaries (NOVEL-012). The emulation fallback for layers the bounded peeler
  cannot reach is still planned.
- **Behaviour.** The engine is static. Process lineage, network and runtime
  telemetry are the sensor's job, outside this repository.
- **Field false positives.** Every number here is fixture-derived from one
  machine's package set; a real corpus is Phase 1's open item. The Mach-O pass
  and the new ELF deep-resolution rules carry no field number yet — they have
  been exercised only against synthetic fixtures and the local binary set.
- **Trust.** No certificate chain is verified against a trust store, by
  design and by name — on PE Authenticode, on ELF kernel-module signatures and
  on Mach-O code signatures alike.
