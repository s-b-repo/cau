# CAU EDR — v2 Plan

## Agent scope note (for human and AI contributors)

This repo is a detection program. Technique knowledge exists here only as detection
requirements: per-technique analytics (Phases 10/11), coverage states, and synthetic
fixtures. The rules, in priority order:

- Implement the detection rows; never implement the techniques themselves — no implant
  code, weaponization, or payload work, and no evasion engineering in any framing.
- Detection analytics are written from public technique definitions, never from the
  internal corpus's bypass notes; those notes stay in the internal program tracker and
  are never mirrored here.
- Fixtures are synthetic and generated at eval time; never built from real samples or
  from internal offensive documents.
- When a task straddles the boundary (partly detection, partly bypass), the part that
  crosses is refused, not split off and shipped.

## Product shape

Two artifacts, two audiences, one paid line — and that line is **multi-agent
management only**. All detection and all prevention are free.

| | `cau` (this repo — engine **and** agent) | `cau-console` (proprietary) |
|---|---|---|
| License | MIT, free, unmetered | Commercial |
| What it is | Everything that **finds and stops** threats on a host: all detection content and scanning, the MCP server, the evaluation harness, **and all prevention/response on the host** (quarantine, restore, block, kill, canaries) | Only the **multi-agent management GUI**: the web console that runs *a fleet of the free agents* from one pane — inventory, central policy distribution, cross-host incident timelines, multi-tenancy, RBAC/SSO, cross-tenant pivoting |
| Persona | Analyst / developer / CI / single-host or standalone-agent operator | SOC / platform team managing many agents centrally |
| Deploy | Anywhere, air-gapped, one host or a standalone agent — fully functional alone | A web console over a fleet of the free agents |

The paywall is **management at fleet scale, nothing else**. Detection and
prevention are free on every host, forever: a single agent detects *and*
responds (quarantine, block, kill) with no license and no metering. The console
is sold only because coordinating, distributing policy to, and governing *many*
agents from one pane is inherently stateful server-side work — it adds **no
detection or prevention capability the free agent lacks**. Nothing a lone agent
can do is ever moved behind the paywall; the paid surface is structurally the
multi-agent pane, not a crippled feature of the agent.

## Program status — what's shipped (engine)

A roll-up of the OSS engine as it stands; the phase sections below hold the
detail and the open items. Everything here is measured and gated in CI
(`make ci`: vet, race tests, rule lint, coverage gate, eval gate).

**Detectors (fifteen, single-pass, plus a fusion lattice):**
- Hash signatures, YARA (in-process libyara), string/API heuristics.
- Static structure — own bounds-checked PE, ELF and Mach-O parsers, entropy,
  packer, overlay, Authenticode, TLSH/ssdeep/imphash/telfhash similarity. ELF
  deep-resolution (`.init_array` reloc targets, symbol versions, raw-syscall
  interposer) and Mach-O (thin/universal, segments, dylibs, code-signature and
  encryption presence) landed 2026-11-02.
- Invisible-codepoint (stego) pass.
- Encoded-executable pass (`scanner/encchain`) — base64/hex layers decoding to
  a PE/ELF header; measured 0.019% FP over 139,860 benign files.
- Shell Link (.lnk) pass (`scanner/lnk`) — [MS-SHLLINK] parser reading
  weaponised-shortcut signals (interpreter arguments, encoded/hidden-window
  flags, env-var path obfuscation, executable target, icon lure, overlay).
- OLE macro pass (`scanner/ole`) — [MS-CFB] parser + [MS-OVBA] decompression
  reading VBA-macro tradecraft (auto-exec entry points, shell/interpreter and
  download calls, obfuscation, embedded-object/Equation-Editor lures).
- PDF document pass (`scanner/pdf`) — bounded lexical scan with `#xx` name
  de-obfuscation reading malicious-PDF tradecraft (auto-run actions, embedded
  JavaScript, Launch, embedded files, JS exploit primitives).
- ISO container pass (`scanner/iso`) — bounded, cycle-safe ISO 9660 (+Joliet)
  directory enumeration reading the mark-of-the-web-bypass smuggling shape
  (a .lnk paired with an executable payload, hidden payloads, autorun.inf).
- Linux software-package pass (`scanner/linuxpkg`, 2026-11-02) — bounded,
  stdlib-only, detection-only reading of the root-run install-time scripts in
  .deb / .rpm / Arch .pkg.tar + PKGBUILD / Flatpak / AppImage / Docker-OCI
  (`docker save`) / Snap packages, generic .zip/.tar installers, executable
  configs (.desktop/XDG/systemd/shell-rc) and APT/nala sources. Scores
  supply-chain tradecraft (curl-into-shell, reverse shell, dropper, persistence,
  sandbox escape; T1195.002 and family). `--no-pkg` / `--pkg-threshold`.
- Archive pass (`scanner/archive`, 2026-11-02) — bounded ZIP/TAR/gzip (+tar.gz
  nesting) container-hygiene analysis: decompression bombs (ratio + absolute
  caps), Zip-Slip/path-traversal members, double-extension lures, disguised
  single-executable payloads, encrypted and nested members. Never writes or
  executes; `--no-archive` / `--archive-threshold`. In the coverage matrix as the
  `archive` source (T1036 / T1204.002 / T1027, no new techniques).
- CHM pass (`scanner/chm`, 2026-11-02) — walks the uncompressed ITSF/ITSP/PMGL
  directory of a Compiled HTML Help file and scores embedded payloads a help file
  has no reason to carry: a lone embedded PE, multiple executables, an embedded
  .lnk, or a dangerous script (.hta/.vbs/.ps1/.bat/.cmd/.wsf, not plain .js).
  T1204.002 / T1059. `--no-chm` / `--chm-threshold`. Honest boundary: the
  LZX content section is not decompressed in v1 ("present but not inspected").
- Fusion lattice — corroboration of sub-threshold detectors; never lowers a
  verdict. The engine verdict now uses the **hybrid** `FuseChained`: the flat
  weighted sum plus bounded, capped attack-path chaining (packed-and-injects,
  document-dropper, peel-revealed), added 2026-11-02.

**Program surfaces:**
- ATT&CK coverage matrix derived from the content, gated against
  `baselines/attack-coverage.txt`; text / JSON / Navigator / SARIF output.
  Covered techniques are recorded; gaps are published, never padded.
- YARA rule linter (`cau rules lint`), `cau rules list`.
- Output: text, versioned JSON (schema 1.10.0), SARIF 2.1.0, OCSF 1.3.0.
- Evaluation harness with a committed smoke corpus and regression gates.
- Threat-intel intake (`cau intake`, `internal/intake`): STIX 2.1 / MISP /
  MalwareBazaar / LOLDrivers parsers that feed the hash signature database from
  machine-readable feeds, deduped against the live DB.
- Response primitives: an integrity-sealed quarantine vault
  (`cau quarantine`, XOR-neutralized at rest, fail-closed restore) and
  decoy/canary files with a baseline tamper check (`cau canary`).
- Live process scan (`cau ps`, `internal/procscan`, 2026-11-02) — a read-only,
  `/proc`-only point-in-time scan of the running process table for what a file
  scan structurally misses: fileless/RAM-only execution (memfd, deleted binary,
  `/dev/shm`), name masquerading / PID hijacking, library-injection hooks, and
  reverse-shell command lines. Never injects, ptraces, or signals. Its
  techniques (T1620, T1036.004/005, T1574.006, T1055.008) are a runtime surface,
  not yet in the `cau coverage` file-scanner matrix.
- Installed-package audit (`cau installed`, 2026-11-02) — audits the
  maintainer/install scripts of already-installed packages in place from dpkg and
  pacman on-disk metadata (offline, read-only), flagging the same tradecraft as the
  `linuxpkg` pass and any abuse-intel indicator reference. RPM is reported as a gap
  (scriptlets live in the rpmdb, not loose files).
- Abuse-intel feed (`cau feed`, `internal/intel`, 2026-11-02) — a hybrid offline
  feed of known-bad IPs/CIDRs/domains/URLs/hashes that `cau scan` (`--feed`),
  `cau installed` and `cau ps` match references against. `list` / `check` /
  `update`; `update` is the only networked action and only with an explicit
  `--url`, otherwise a plain offline file.
- Obfuscation-chain peeler (`cau peel`, and a `peeler` detector + fusion source
  wired into `cau scan`): a bounded, budget-walled tree unwrap (base64/base32/
  hex, gzip/zlib/flate/bzip2) where depth is the signal; `peel-exhausted` is a
  first-class outcome and a revealed payload flags only at chain depth >= 2
  (0/116,201 benign FP, 0/291 on the repo). T1027 (partial).
- MCP server (`cau-mcp`): the engine over JSON-RPC on stdio (with an optional
  streamable-HTTP transport, `--http <addr>`) — nine tools
  (scan/explain/test-and-draft-rules/coverage), signature and coverage
  resources, two triage/review prompts, all behind a path-confined sandbox.

**Robustness (engine hardening):**
- Coverage-guided fuzzers on every untrusted-input parser (`make fuzz`),
  per-file panic isolation, and a reachable PE/ELF-parser OOB plus overflow and
  32-bit bugs fixed.
- Detection-robustness harnesses for all four content detectors; they found and
  closed two case-sensitivity gaps (wannacry, generic-ransomware extensions).

**ATT&CK coverage of shipped content:** the engine now covers 95 techniques
with content — 92 covered and 3 partial (up from 59 when this paragraph was
last written, and from 46 after the Linux software-package detector landed
2026-11-02: T1195.002, T1547.013, T1496, T1059.004, T1562.001, T1140,
T1098.004, T1548.003, T1222.002, T1543.002, T1053.003, T1546.004, T1105,
T1571, T1027, T1070, and T1542.001 System Firmware from the UEFI scan), and the
expectation (`baselines/attack-coverage.txt`)
carries no hard `gap` rows left — the document/archive detectors closed the
last ones. The
honest incompleteness is now carried by **`partial`** rows: T1057 and T1082
(discovery via string/import patterns only) and T1564.001 (the ISO-container
hidden-payload facet ships; host-filesystem hidden executables remain a Phase 11
sensor row). Limitations are still published — as `partial` states and the
"content with no ATT&CK technique" list — rather than as `gap` rows. A
follow-up worth taking: widen the expectation to track genuinely-uncovered
techniques as new published gaps, so the counterfactual stays visible.

**Measured 2026-11-11** (`v0.3.0-2-g8cdb25b`, re-run end to end): the first
recall number that is not synthetic. A local lab
corpus of real offensive tooling, split by tool, took held-out detection from 25.4 %
to 61.1 % (`docs/evaluation.md`). Recall against real malware (`make eval-recall`)
is still unmeasured, so the Phase 1 "real corpus" item stays open.

**Not yet shipped (see phases):** the live intelligence-feed *sync* (the intake
parsers — STIX / MISP / MalwareBazaar / LOLDrivers — and `cau intake` shipped
2026-11-02; the TAXII client and scheduled pull remain) and the EU-framework
bindings (Phase 4), the ML ladder (Phase 5), the
layer-peeler's follow-ons (the entropy/structural estimator and emulation
fallback — the bounded tree core and its scan-path wiring shipped 2026-11-02)
and the other NOVEL-012 items (Phase 10 / Phase 12), the deeper firmware
surfaces (Phase 8 — the `cau firmware` FV/FFS inventory + tamper/implant check
shipped 2026-11-02; option-ROM/WPBT/boot-order/efivarfs analysis and
section-level YARA remain), and the entire console/sensor
control plane (proprietary).

## Phase 0 — Unblock the fork (blocking) — DONE 2026-10-24

All findings were verified against `0f0c000` in `s-b-repo/Astra-AV-Engine` and
every item below is closed. Notes on what was actually measured:

- Heuristics retune, measured on 349 files in Kali's `/usr/share/windows-resources`:
  detections 60 → 28; plink 24 → 5, vncviewer 11 → 4, dbghelp.dll 13 → 4;
  mimikatz / wce / pwdump / shellter stay detected. OllyDbg (11) remains a
  documented false positive: a debugger has an injector's import profile.
- Bundled rules were ASCII-only and never fired on `mimikatz.exe` (wide
  strings). Now `ascii wide`; the loose ransomware-extension rule, which hit
  18 Go binaries in `/usr/bin`, requires a ransom-note name alongside extensions.
- `exec.CommandContext` is moot: nothing shells out any more; libyara gets a
  per-scan timeout instead (`--yara-timeout`, default 30s, 0 rejected).
- Tags + releases: the CI workflow builds a release tarball on `v*` tags; no
  tag has been cut yet.

**Dependency**
- [x] Switch to `github.com/hillu/go-yara/v4` bindings. Declared in `go.mod:5`, imported
      nowhere, no `go.sum`. Remove all `exec.Command("yara", ...)` in `scanner/yara.go`.
- [x] Compile the ruleset once at startup; scan in memory. Kills
      O(files x rules) process spawning (`yara.go:78-91`) and the per-sample rules-dir
      re-walk (`yara.go:71`). `Neo23x0/signature-base` is ~3k rules — current code spawns
      3k processes per sample.
- [x] `exec.CommandContext` everywhere YARA / external tools run. No timeout = adversarial
      sample hangs the scanner permanently.

**Correctness**
- [x] Per-rule-file error isolation. `yara.go:89` returns mid-loop and discards already
      collected matches; one broken rule silently turns a sample CLEAN.
- [x] Capture rule `meta` + real namespace (`yara -p -g -m -e -s`). Today `threat_level`,
      `author`, `in_the_wild` in `rule_list.yar` are parsed and discarded.
- [x] Stop suppressing rule warnings (`-w`). Rule authors need to see dead rules.
- [x] `AddSignature` / `LoadSignatures`: validate hex + exact length per type, reject
      duplicates, detect cross-type collisions.
- [x] Fix signature DB. 53 entries → 51 unique; 2 duplicates silently overwrite via
      `entries[hash] = sig` (`scanner.go:92`); 10 entries have invalid 63-char SHA256s
      (lines 17, 34, 37, 42, 46, 56, 57, 65, 66, 101); ~38 are synthetic filler
      (`a1b2c3d4e5f6…`, `f0e1d2c3b4a5…`, `2d4f6a8c0e2b…`). Only ~15 are real.
- [x] `db.Count()` returns map size, not entry count — under-reports at load.

**Heuristics**
- [x] Fix score inflation. `heuristics.go:255` dedups on `pattern|extractedString`, so
      each distinct string containing `http://` scores +1 → 200 URLs = score 200 vs
      threshold 3. Collapse to per-pattern caps.
- [x] Retune weights. `Sleep` / `connect` / `GetTickCount` in the IAT of ordinary
      networked software. Threshold 3 is unshippable as-is.
- [x] Size cap before `os.ReadFile` (`heuristics.go:164`) — 4 GB file currently OOMs.
- [x] `main.go:249` re-reads and re-parses every file including already-matched and
      errored ones. Single-pass file access.

**Interface**
- [x] Exit codes (`--fail-on`). Currently always 0 — useless in CI.
- [x] JSON + SARIF output. Text banner cannot be consumed by anything.
- [x] Concurrency for `--dir`.
- [x] Resource defaults relative to the binary break on install to `/usr/bin`; and
      `--rules` defaults empty so YARA is off despite the README advertising it.

**Hygiene**
- [x] Tests (0 exist). CI. Makefile. `.gitignore`. Tags + releases.
- [x] README is stale: roadmap still marks Episode 3 planned (it's implemented), structure
      lists `rules/malware_generic.yar` (actual `rule_list.yar`) and omits
      `heuristics.go`, example output says v0.2.0, clone URL points at upstream.
- [x] Module path is still `ASTRA-LabsHQ` — `go get` on the fork yields upstream code.
- [x] Two rules can never fire: `highly_sus_shellcode` and `obfuscated_powershell` match
      the *text* `"0x89,0x00,0x00,0x00,0x60,0x89"`, i.e. comma-hex rendering, not bytes.

---

## Phase 1 — Evaluation harness (blocking for everything after) — DONE 2026-10-24

`cau eval validate|run|report|diff|gate|policy`, `internal/eval`, the committed
`corpus/smoke` plus `baselines/smoke.json` and `baselines/policy.json`, and
`make eval` in CI. Still open within this phase: a *real* corpus. The smoke
corpus proves the plumbing; recall numbers against it are not detection
quality numbers. Next: a manifest referencing MalwareBazaar samples by hash
(fetched at eval time into an isolated directory, never committed) and a
benign set built from Debian/Chocolatey package provenance.

- [x] Corpus format + loader (public malware with handling rules, benign set by build
      provenance so "clean" is actually verified, not assumed)
- [x] Deterministic metric runner: FP/FN/precision/recall per detector, per rule, per
      family; confusion matrix; regression gate vs. `main` baseline
- [x] Report diffing — "this PR adds 0.4% recall and 3x the false positives"
- [x] Performance budget gate (throughput, memory, no timeout regressions)

---

## Phase 2 — Episodes 4/5/6, done properly — DONE 2026-10-25

All cheap. All measurable against Phase 1. Each row below lands with ATT&CK mapping,
a model card bearing FP/FN against the eval corpus, and a benchstat entry under
`cau bench` so the perf-sweep contract applies the day the feature ships, not after.

Shipped as `scanner/static` (own bounds-checked PE parser — `debug/pe` drops ordinal
imports, which breaks imphash), surfaced as `ScanResult.Static`, the `static` eval
detector, JSON schema 1.1.0, a SARIF `static/score` rule, and `cau hash` / `cau
cluster` / `cau add-fuzzy`. Notes on what was actually measured:

- Weights and the threshold (8) were tuned on the 49 PE files in Kali's
  `/usr/share/windows-resources`: 43 score 0; the UPX-packed GNU `wget.exe` scores 7
  (`packer.upx` + RWX + high-entropy section) and the ASPack-packed `klogger.exe` 6 —
  both render as *low suspicion* with the packer named, because packed is not
  malicious and the plan says so; credential tools (mimikatz, wce, PwDump) score 0
  here by design, that is the heuristic detector's job. A synthetic UPX stub with a
  loader-only import table scores ≥ 9 and a self-signed certificate wearing a vendor
  name crosses on its own.
- Three real Authenticode chains parse (plink, dbghelp.dll, mimidrv.sys). Two are
  cross-signed and end at an external root, which the result names
  (`chain_terminus`); `verified` is always false because the engine holds no trust
  store, and every report says so. Go refuses SHA-1 chain verification, so
  issuer-name linking is the documented fallback for pre-2016 chains.
- Delphi's constant 1992 link timestamp, kernel drivers' RWX `INIT` section,
  MinGW's `msvcrt.dll` and reproducible-build timestamps are all explicit non-findings
  — each one was a false positive on the first measurement pass.
- Imphash follows pefile's algorithm including its ws2_32/wsock32/oleaut32 ordinal
  tables. TLSH/ssdeep thresholds are published constants (≤ 30 / ≥ 70); a match lands
  in the SUSPICIOUS tier with its distance attached. The fuzzy database ships empty;
  content arrives through the Phase 4 intake, never hand-typed.
- Import clustering (exact imphash + 64-slot MinHash with 16×4 LSH bands) groups every
  x86/x64 pair of the same tool in the fixture set at ≥ 0.6 Jaccard.
- Perf: 44 MB/s with fuzzy hashing on a 1.3 MB binary, 180 MB/s without; the eval gate
  stays green with the new detector present (baseline re-recorded).
- Deferred, with owners: the emulation sidecar and the bounded peeler stay in
  Phase 10 (NOVEL-012); lolcerts intake for signer implausibility is Phase 4.

- [x] imphash + import clustering (nearest-neighbour family grouping from flat hashes).
  Clustering uses locality-sensitive hashing on import strings; cluster size and
  cluster-prevalence per fleet (Phase 7 #5) become FP suppressors — a cluster of 2 on
  10k hosts is a very different signal from a cluster of 10k. Clusters carry stable
  IDs across releases so analyst dispositions (verdict feedback ledger) persist.
- [x] TLSH + ssdeep fuzzy hashing (Episode 6) — survives the trivial single-byte flip.
  Thresholds published per corpus class with measured FP; a nearest-neighbour verdict
  always carries the distance and the matched sample's own class, never only a boolean.
  Fuzzy-match verdicts enter the fusion lattice (detection-quality program) rather than
  firing standalone.
- [x] Shannon entropy overall + per section + sliding window; packer/overlay detection.
  Entropy segments are inputs to the chain-depth estimator (NOVEL-012 peeler), so the
  work pays twice. Entropy is never a verdict alone — it is one input to fusion, and
  the row's model card carries the FP curve against the benign corpus.
- [x] Rich header, timestamp-vs-Rich anomaly, Authenticode chain + signer implausibility.
  Signer-implausibility pairs with the lolcerts intake (abused code-signing certs) and
  the trust-store drift row — the one signal that benefits from three independent data
  sources landing in the same model.
- [x] Section anomalies: rwx, name mismatch, size/entropy outliers, TLS callbacks.
  Each class is a labeled sub-row; the renderer explains *which* anomaly fired, not a
  single opaque score. ATT&CK mapping lands on each (T1027.009 for RWX stagers,
  T1055 adjacent for TLS-callback injection patterns).
- [x] Packer detection (UPX, Themida, VMProtect) via entrypoint + section signatures.
  Packer identity drives the peeler's handler choice (NOVEL-012) rather than being a
  verdict in itself — a signed, Debian-shipped UPX binary is not malicious; it is
  packed, correctly, by provenance. Peel-exhausted packed samples route to the Phase 5
  emulation sidecar before any clean verdict is emitted.
- [x] Resource/overlay anomalies: appended-data detection past declared image end,
  oversized resource sections, resource-language mismatches (installer claiming
  en-US with Cyrillic strings), icon-hash lookups against known-good families — a
  pattern that catches the "legit installer wrapper with payload tail" class.
- [x] Delay-import and bound-import plane: delay-load table anomalies and
  bound-import timestamp mismatches, both historically neglected because the fields
  are rarely parsed by free-tier scanners.
- [x] Debug-directory and PDB-path leakage: PDB-path extraction (build-host fingerprint,
  developer-handle inference) renders as metadata only — a signal useful for clustering
  and threat-intel pivots, never as a verdict. The row documents the privacy posture
  loudly: PDB paths are *attacker-controlled strings* under the analytic-design rule and
  cannot anchor a detection.
- [x] Format-coverage honesty: the PE pass runs today; ELF (Phase 9), Mach-O (Phase 9
  decision), OLE/PDF/LNK/CHM/ISO (Phase 9), script formats (install-plane shscanner) and
  firmware images (Phase 8) each get their *own* phase-2-equivalent surface — overall
  format coverage is published in `cau coverage` as a format matrix beside the ATT&CK
  matrix, so the plan does not accidentally imply "PE-only" is "complete".
- [x] Perf contract: single-pass PE access, mmap-backed parsing, per-worker memory
  budgets enforced by the Phase 1 gates; benchstat baseline published on the first
  release that includes the row.

## Phase 3 — MCP server (OSS) — DONE 2026-10-30

Highest differentiation per line of code. No competitor ships an AV *engine* as MCP —
`revula`, `Reversecore_MCP`, `NexusCore_MCP` are RE/debugging toolchains.

Shipped 2026-10-30 as `cau-mcp` (`cmd/cau-mcp`, `internal/mcp`): JSON-RPC 2.0
over the line-delimited stdio transport, stdlib-only (no SDK dependency), the
transport abstracted behind `Serve(io.Reader, io.Writer)` so the optional
streamable-HTTP transport can be added without touching the handlers. The
sandbox (`internal/mcp/sandbox.go`) enforces path confinement against a
`--root` allowlist with symlink-escape rejection, a per-file size cap, and
bounded directory enumeration; every tool result is a bounded, summarized JSON
payload (truncation is always reported, never silent). Resource discovery moved
to `internal/resources` so the server and the CLI resolve databases/rules
identically.

Tools shipped: `scan_file`, `scan_dir`, `scan_hash`, `explain_verdict`,
`yara_test_rule`, `generate_yara_rule`, `list_signatures`, `add_signature`,
`mitre_coverage`. Resources: `cau://signatures`, `cau://coverage`,
`cau://rules/{name}`. Prompts: `triage_sample`, `rule_review`.

Scope-note deviations from the sketch below, stated plainly:
- `evasion_report` (tool) and `evasion_assessment` (prompt) are **not** shipped:
  they belong to the Phase 6 evasion suite, which the agent scope note keeps
  out of the engine. They are omitted, not stubbed.
- `cau://corpus/{sample}/report` waits on evaluation-corpus addressing;
  `cau://model/{name}/card` waits on the Phase 5 ML ladder. Neither is
  advertised until it exists.
- `rule_review` ships (false-positive-risk assessment is detection quality, not
  evasion).

Follow-up shipped 2026-10-30: the **streamable-HTTP transport** (`cau-mcp
--http <addr>`, `internal/mcp/http.go`) — a single `/mcp` endpoint taking a
JSON-RPC message by POST and returning the response as `application/json`.
Requests are dispatched one at a time (the signature database's Add is not
concurrency safe); the server sends no unsolicited messages, so the JSON
response subset is complete without SSE. Phase 3 is now feature-complete.

```
cmd/cau-mcp/          # stdio primary, streamable-HTTP optional
internal/mcp/           # tools / resources / prompts registry
internal/mcp/sandbox.go # path allowlist, size caps, timeouts, TOCTOU guards
```

**Tools**: `scan_file`, `scan_dir`, `scan_hash`, `explain_verdict` (which rule, which
score, which offset), `yara_test_rule` (against corpus, returns FP/FN), `generate_yara_rule`,
`list_signatures`, `add_signature`, `mitre_coverage`, `evasion_report`.

**Resources**: `cau://rules/{name}`, `cau://signatures`, `cau://corpus/{sample}/report`,
`cau://model/{name}/card`.

**Prompts**: `triage_sample`, `rule_review` (FP risk of a proposed rule), `evasion_assessment`.

**Non-negotiables**
- Bounded, summarized results. Raw YARA offset dumps blow out agent context.
- Path confinement. This is a scanner pointed at `/` by an agent sooner or later.
- Sampling runs in a sandboxed worker (`read_only`, `cap_drop: ALL`, no network) — never
  the agent's own host filesystem.
- Structured JSON only.

---

## Phase 4 — Intelligence & detection content

- [~] STIX/TAXII + MalwareBazaar sync; replaces the hand-typed `hashes.txt` — MISP is the
  canonical EU sync protocol (see intake table)
  **Parsers shipped 2026-11-02** as `internal/intake` + `cau intake`: STIX 2.1 bundles
  (indicator `file:hashes` patterns), MISP event JSON (md5/sha1/sha256 attributes,
  incl. `filename|hash` composites), MalwareBazaar query/dump JSON (and the abuse.ch
  CSV), and LOLDrivers catalog JSON — "the first real corpus to replace synthetic
  `hashes.txt` filler." Each normalizes to validated hash signatures, dedupes against
  the live DB (never re-labels an existing entry), and appends in the DB's own
  `TYPE|hash|name` format; `--input`/stdin or an explicit `--url` fetch (bounded, never
  automatic), with `--dry-run`/`--output`. Fixture tests per format.
  **TAXII client and weekly sync shipped 2026-11-06:** `cau intake --taxii <collection>`
  (`internal/intake/taxii.go`) polls a TAXII 2.1 collection with envelope pagination, a
  persisted `added_after` cursor (`--taxii-state`), HTTPS-only by default, no cross-host
  redirect, and bounds on pages, objects and bytes; `.github/workflows/intake.yml` runs
  weekly. **Open:** the workflow has only been dry-run locally (its steps against a file
  feed), not yet on a GitHub runner, and the client has been tested against protocol-level
  fixtures, not a live MISP/OpenCTI TAXII server. MalwareBazaar's API now needs a key, so
  the weekly run reads LOLDrivers plus an optional configured TAXII collection.
- [~] Release-channel hash updates: `cau update` fetches the latest signed
  `signatures/hashes.txt` asset from GitHub Releases on a pinned repo
  (`s-b-repo/cau`), and the CI release job publishes that asset per tag.
  Verification is fail-closed: detached signature checked against the package-pinned key
  (Phase 7 #1) before install, DB version and min-engine-version parsed, atomically
  replaces the live DB with a rollback copy. Never phones home silently at startup —
  explicit command, or opt-in periodic in config. No network available keeps the current
  DB with a loud warning. Offline/air-gap deployments receive the identical payload
  through the Phase 7 #10 signed bundle instead of a fetch.
  **Verify-and-apply core shipped 2026-11-02** as `internal/updater` + `cau update`:
  an Ed25519-signed three-file bundle (`hashes.txt` + `manifest.json` +
  `manifest.json.sig`, one signature over the manifest which carries the payload's
  SHA-256). Fail-closed by construction — a bad signature, a payload-digest mismatch, an
  unmet `min_engine_version`, or no configured key all leave the live DB untouched; a
  success swaps it atomically and keeps `<db>.bak`. The bundle is read from `--from <dir>`
  or an explicit `--url` fetch (identical payload for air-gap via a directory), `--dry-run`
  verifies only, and the trusted key comes from `--pubkey` / `$CAU_UPDATE_PUBKEY` / the
  source-pinned `pinnedUpdateKey`. Full unit + CLI tests (install, rollback, tamper, wrong
  key, no-key). **CI signing shipped 2026-11-02:** the GitHub Actions release job
  (on a `v*` tag, on GitHub's workers) signs each release with the
  `CAU_RELEASE_SIGNING_KEY` secret — `cau bundle update` builds the signed update
  bundle, `cau bundle checksums` a signed `SHA256SUMS`, `cau selftest --record
  --sign-key` a signed content baseline — and `cau verify-self` self-verifies the
  built binary before publishing (a release that cannot verify itself never ships).
  The binary references itself at runtime via `cau verify-self` (computes its own
  SHA-256, checks it against the signed `SHA256SUMS` over HTTPS or an air-gapped
  copy, signature-before-hash). **Opt-in periodic update shipped 2026-11-06:**
  `packaging/systemd/cau-update.service` + `cau-update.timer` run `cau verify-self`
  and then `cau update` weekly, unprivileged and sandboxed, writing only the signature
  database directory; nothing enables them, and the unit refuses to run until the
  operator has set the release URL and the pinned public key. Validated with
  `systemd-analyze verify`, not yet run against a real release. **Open (ops):**
  generating and storing the release keypair. An
  out-of-band ICMP/QUIC echo-lane fetch of the manifest remains the plan's future
  (proprietary, raw-socket/PQ-QUIC) transport; the signed-manifest-over-HTTPS path
  is the secure way shipped now.
- [x] YARA rule linter — catches the dead rules already shipped in `rule_list.yar`.
      Shipped 2026-10-29 as `cau rules lint` (`internal/rulelint`): compile
      diagnostics, required meta, technique-id shape, hex-as-text, short and
      narrow strings, trivial conditions; `cau` and `generic` profiles; `make
      lint-rules` in CI. Found on the bundled set: no rule declared a technique.
- [x] Content test-before-promote: every rule change runs against Phase 1 corpus with
      measured regression, blocks merge on FP regression. Satisfied by the
      Phase 1 regression gate wired into CI: `make eval-gate` runs `cau eval
      run` over the corpus and `cau eval gate` against `baselines/smoke.json`
      under `baselines/policy.json`, whose `max_new_false_positives: 0` /
      `max_recall_drop: 0` fail the build on any FP or recall regression. The CI
      workflow runs it on every push and pull_request, so a rule change cannot
      merge without passing. (The corpus is the committed smoke set until the
      Phase 4 intake feeds replace the synthetic filler.)
- [x] ATT&CK mapping on rules + a coverage matrix that reports techniques with **no**
      rule. This is the honest counterfactual to what CrowdStrike sells. Shipped
      2026-10-29 as `cau coverage` (`internal/coverage`): derived from
      `scanner.Categories`, the new `static.Classes` / `stego.Classes` catalogs and
      the compiled rules' `mitre_attack` meta (every bundled rule now declares one);
      text, JSON and ATT&CK Navigator layer; Pyramid of Pain level per source;
      unmapped content listed. `baselines/attack-coverage.txt` is the expectation
      (37 covered, 3 declared gaps: T1027.013, T1140, T1564.001) and
      `make coverage-gate` fails on any difference. The Phase 11 `--format sarif`
      rendering of per-technique states stays open.
- [~] Bind EU alternatives to the matrix so mapping never hinges on a single US registry:
      Unified Kill Chain (Fox-IT / P. Pols, NL) mapped phase-wise alongside ATT&CK as the
      sequencing view, MISP galaxy-cluster IDs (CIRCL, Luxembourg) for actor/family
      tagging, Malpedia IDs (Fraunhofer FKIE, Germany) as the family-naming record, ENISA
      Threat Landscape taxonomy (EU) for the strategic dashboard layer, CERT-EU's ATT&CK
      community mappings as external review. Report findings carry a `frameworks` object
      (ATT&CK id, UKC phase, MISP cluster, Malpedia family) so consumers pick their scheme.
      **UKC binding shipped 2026-11-02** as `internal/frameworks` + `cau coverage
      --frameworks`: each covered ATT&CK technique is mapped through its tactic onto the
      18-phase Unified Kill Chain, and the sequencing view groups the shipped content by
      stage (Initial Foothold / Network Propagation / Action on Objectives) with the empty
      phases named as honest gaps — the file scanner cannot see Reconnaissance,
      Weaponization, Exploitation, Pivoting, Exfiltration or Objectives, and says so
      (11/18 phases covered). The `Binding` type also carries `MISPCluster` and
      `MalpediaFamily`, left for an intel feed to populate because they tag a sample, not a
      technique. Scan report findings now carry a `frameworks` array on the `fusion` object
      (ATT&CK id + UKC phase/stage per technique; JSON schema 1.10.0), so consumers pick
      their scheme. **Intake tagging shipped 2026-11-06:** MISP galaxy-cluster tags
      (`misp-galaxy:<galaxy>="<value>"`) on a MISP event or attribute, or in a STIX
      indicator's labels, are carried verbatim into the intake provenance record
      (`misp_clusters`), and a `misp-galaxy:malpedia` cluster sets `malpedia_family`; the
      engine never maps a feed's free-text label onto a Malpedia name. **Open:** the tags
      stop at the provenance file, because the signature database is still three fields,
      so a scan finding's `frameworks` object does not carry them yet; and the ENISA
      strategic layer.

**LOTL intake (the lolol.farm meta-catalog)** — lolol.farm indexes ~30 community catalogs.
Ingest the upstream machine-readable sources on GitHub, never hand-typed; lolol.farm is
the discovery index and the weekly drift check that nothing we consume has gone quiet:

| Catalog | Feeds |
|---|---|
| LOLDrivers | known-malicious driver SHA256s + signing intel; first real corpus to replace synthetic `hashes.txt` filler |
| MalAPI / LOLAPI | cross-check and extend the hand-typed `suspiciousAPIs` table; ATT&CK mapping per API comes free |
| LOLBAS / GTFOBins / GTFOArgs / LOLGlobs / ArgFuscator | command patterns for string heuristics + obfuscation variants as eval corpora for the Phase 6 evasion suite |
| HijackLibs | DLL-sideload candidates for a PE rule pack, alongside the Phase 2 section work |
| lolcerts (WithSecure, FI) | abused code-signing certificates — feeds Phase 2 signer-implausibility; the ground truth behind the "Certs Are Useless" thesis. **Consumer shipped 2026-11-02**: the static pass extracts each cert's SHA-1/SHA-256 thumbprint and matches it (or serial+issuer) against a known-abused-signer blocklist (`cau scan --signers`, `static.SignerBlocklist`), emitting `authenticode.known-abused-signer` (weight 9, T1553.002) — a valid signature from a stolen/abused key is flagged. Blocklist is a JSON or line file (stdlib-only); converting the lolcerts YAML into that file is the remaining ops step. |
| LOTS / LOLC2 / LOT Webhooks / LOT Tunnels / LOLFSaaS | exfil/C2 string + domain patterns for the network heuristics; attenuation handled by prevalence (Phase 7 #5) |
| WTFBins / LoFP | binaries that behave like malware but are innocent, plus generated FP rule sets — seeds the benign corpus for weak-category retuning |
| LOLRMM / FileSec / Bootloaders / Persistence-Info / LOLSkills | RMM-tool abuse lists, delivery-file extensions, UEFI loaders, persistence-mechanism cross-checks, and YARA over AI agent skill bundles (ties into Phase 3 MCP scanning) |

- [x] Intake lives in `internal/intake/`: fetchers, parsers, fixture tests, weekly CI run.
      Every consumed record carries source, retrieved-at and confidence fields. Nothing
      from a feed auto-promotes into shipped detection content — every item still runs the
      Phase 1 gates before promotion. Feeds cut bookkeeping cost, never undermine FP gates.
      **Shipped 2026-11-06.** `cau intake --provenance <file>` appends a JSON line per new
      signature (source, origin, retrieved-at, confidence). Confidence is what the source
      states (STIX `confidence` on the None/Low/Med/High scale) and `unstated` otherwise;
      the engine does not invent one. Withdrawn intel is no longer ingested: STIX
      indicators that are `revoked` or past `valid_until`, MISP attributes with
      `to_ids: false`. The weekly workflow writes candidates to an artifact, runs them
      through `cau eval gate` against the smoke baseline, fails when a feed parses to
      zero indicators (the drift check), and never commits. Of the LOTL table above only
      LOLDrivers and the lolcerts consumer are wired; the other catalogs remain open.

## Phase 5 — ML ladder

Static engines lose to packing. Each tier earns its place only where the previous fails.

| Tier | Approach | Cost | Reality |
|---|---|---|---|
| 0 | imphash + TLSH | ~0 | Beats exact hashes on modified/packed samples |
| 1 | LightGBM on PE header/section/byte-histogram (EMBER-class) | ms | Reference static baseline; the pragmatic workhorse |
| 2 | CFG → GNN (GraphSAGE / GIN) | 100ms–s | Needs angr/CFGFast. MalAOI evades at 93.7% avg, 99.2% on GAT |
| 3 | LLM static analyst over FLOSS/decompiled output | s | Best ROI on obfuscated samples; also the rule-generation engine |
| 4 | Dynamic API-call graph → GNN/transformer | sandbox | The only tier that survives packing. GraphShield-class: 99.5% F1 @ <1% FPR |

- [~] ONNX Runtime sidecar over gRPC from the Go core. Do not do inference in Go.
  **The engine's half shipped 2026-11-10** as `internal/sidecar` + `cau model score`:
  the core asks a sidecar to score bytes and gets scores back; it never loads a
  model into its own process, and `TestNoInferenceInTheEngine` (a source gate
  beside the injection gate) keeps it that way — a runtime linked into the core
  would put a model inside the process that reads hostile files. The protocol is
  a length-prefixed JSON frame over a unix socket, so the core needs no
  dependency of its own to speak it. **Open:** the transport is not gRPC: the
  repository vendors no protobuf or gRPC dependency and the standard library
  has neither, so the frame is JSON and the production sidecar (an ONNX Runtime
  service) has to speak the same frame. The artifact formats the sidecar
  accepts, and the sidecar image itself, are the operator's.
- [ ] Adversarial training mandatory — reduces evasion, does not remove it.
  **Declined here, on purpose:** this is a training programme, not a detection
  row: it needs a model, a training pipeline and training data, none of which
  this repository ships, and the corpus policy says the data is synthetic and
  generated at eval time. What ships instead is the measurement half — the
  evasion report and the bench — which is what tells an operator whether their
  content is fragile, without a training pipeline pretending to be a
  contribution.
- [x] **Temporal generalization as a hard CI gate.** Train on period A, score on period B,
      fail on AUC drop. TESSERACT / Arp et al.: temporal snooping is the field's most
      widespread evaluation flaw. Flat-feature models look best in-distribution and are
      among the worst across a time boundary — a conventional benchmark would reject
      message passing entirely. Making this a gate is a differentiator. Shipped in the
      engine's form (`cau eval temporal`, `make temporal-gate`, its own CI lane): a
      corpus declares the period each sample belongs to, the corpus is cut at the
      boundary, and the shipped content must not lose more recall across it than the
      policy allows. There is no model here — what has to generalise across the
      boundary is the detection content, and the gate says how much of it did not.
      The per-detector table is the diagnostic: a rule that stopped carrying a period
      shows up even when another rule covers for it.
- [x] Model registry with signed artifacts, SBOM, model cards, promote/rollback. Shipped
      (`internal/model`, `cau model`): the registry is signed with the same trust anchor as
      the release manifest and the update bundle, over its own canonical bytes and in its
      own signature domain; every artifact is named by its digest and carries an SBOM
      and a model card, and a model without either is refused at parse time. `promote`
      makes a version active and remembers the one it replaced, `rollback` returns to it,
      and both rewrite the document — so a promotion is an act that has to be signed again.
      The registry never runs anything: inference belongs to a sidecar.

---

## Phase 6 — Episode 7: the evasion suite (OSS, flagship)

The credibility engine. Nobody ships this, and it is defensible purely on being honest.

- [x] `cau evasion report --file X` → per detector, the bytes that must change for it
      to stop firing, with the evasion distance. Shipped (`internal/evasion`,
      `cmd_evasion.go`): the distance comes from the detection's own evidence (the
      matched hash, the rule's condition read back and costed, the invisible
      codepoints, the overlay's size), and a detector whose distance cannot be
      derived is reported as not derivable rather than given a number nobody
      checked. **The patch set is deliberately not shipped**: the scope note says
      the part that crosses into bypass is refused, not split off and shipped, so
      the report names the change and carries no offsets, no matched bytes and no
      mutated sample. `docs/evasion.md` states the line and why.
- [ ] Adversarial harness implementing the published state of the art:
      XAI-guided function-call replacement via integrated gradients (94–100% success),
      MalAOI-style RL active-opcode insertion (93.7%), PhantomCall FCG dummy-function
      injection (85–100%, +95 pts over prior SOTA). **Declined, on purpose:** these
      are attack generators. The scope note refuses the technique side outright, and
      the measurement side is what the plan's own claim needs.
- [x] Benchmark every detector against the suite. A detector that cannot be attacked has
      not been tested. Shipped as the measurement half: `cau evasion bench --corpus M`
      runs the shipped detectors over a corpus the operator supplies (the eval
      harness's own manifest format, so the numbers come from the corpus the
      recall figures are published from) and reports, per detector, how often it
      fired and how many of its firings were one byte from silence. The corpus is
      the operator's: the repository ships no attacks and generates none.

---

## Phase 7 — Getting past CrowdStrike (10 bets)

Do not out-build them — 10k engineers and a decade of Threat Graph telemetry are not
beaten symmetrically. Every bet below is asymmetric: it is something they structurally
cannot publish, price, or install. Each item lands on top of an asset Phase 1/6 already
builds (the eval harness, the evasion suite, the sensor fleet).

### Organized publication (what they will never publish)

**1. Signature provenance + per-rule model cards, in the public repo.**
Every threshold, indicator weight and YARA rule ships with: corpus hit/FP counts from
Phase 1, ATT&CK mapping, last-measured date, and a signed manifest (SLSA attestations on
the release). A competitor's detection layer is a black box by definition; being able to
fork, diff and audit detection content is the analyst-facing wedge.

**2. Continuous public multi-vendor benchmark.**
Automate the same public-corpus run against VirusTotal's multi-engine results on
identical samples (VT API, hash-referenced manifests — raw samples never committed):
place CAU next to Falcon in the same table, with evasion distance and method
disclosure, published weekly. The market has ATT&CK Evaluations (slow, vendor-approved,
closed method) and marketing decks; it has no open one. The *methodology* being published
is what makes it defensible.

**3. MITRE ATT&CK Evaluations enrollment.**
Register for the enterprise rounds instead of only maintaining an internal matrix
(Phase 4 keeps its scope). Participation is a procurement shortcut: vendors with no
evaluation record are excluded from shortlists regardless of quality, and this plan's
boldness only counts if it is externally checked.

**4. Published pricing + public TCO calculator.**
Managed-agent console tiers and volume pricing (detection and prevention are free and
unmetered; only the multi-agent management console is licensed — already decided in
pricing mechanics) as a public page sourced from a
checked-in `pricing.toml`. Falcon's pricing is opaque per-host licensing and procurement
teams compare against list prices. Give them a downloadable TCO model with the honest
assumption rows.

### Sensor capability (what their scale can't discount)

**5. Fleet-derived prevalence scoring.**
Global file prevalence (SHA256, imphash-cluster, TCM) computed from sensor + scan-node
telemetry — but bootstrapped from SBOM/provenance imports (Debian, Chocolatey, npm,
Hackage) so a *new* engine has ground-truth benign prevalence before the fleet itself
populates it. Prevalence is the single strongest FP suppressor and the reason Falcon's
cloud decisioning feels precise. Deliverable: `internal/prevalence`, exposed as a metric
in every verdict ("seen on 0.0004% of hosts; signed by Debian").
**Host half shipped 2026-11-07** as `internal/provenance` + `cau scan --provenance`:
every scanned file resolves against dpkg or pacman to owner, version, state and the
shipped digest (usr-merge and diversions handled, conffiles distinguished, rpm reported
unsupported), carried in every output format, plus the unscored observation
`provenance.modified-system-binary` (T1554) for a package-owned executable whose content
no longer matches. Measured on 4,157 system binaries: 4,154 intact, 1 real local rebuild,
0 false "modified". It attenuates nothing yet: no fusion weight has been measured, so it
is reported beside the verdict. **Open:** the fleet prevalence itself and the SBOM
bootstrap (console work), feeding the anchor into scoring, and a "signed by" statement
(dpkg records digests, not signatures).

**6. Behavior engine (IOBs) on the sensor.**
Static tiers lose to packing; the behavior layer does not. Sensor-side process-behavior
scoring over the existing event subscriptions (API sequences, ETW/AMSI anomalies,
file-less staging, RWX staging) emitted as ATT&CK-mapped behavioral indicators — the
Episodes 8+ work, formalized: rules live in `internal/behavior`, measured per technique
with the same FP/FN harness as the static content, gated in CI.

**7. eBPF Linux sensor.**
Linux dominates servers and CI, which is exactly where the OSS engine already deploys as
scan nodes. An eBPF-CO-RE collector (`cmd/cau-sensor-ebpf`) yields endpoint telemetry
without a kernel driver — the position CrowdStrike cannot copy into an MIT engine and
their Linux agent's weight makes the agent-footprint numbers a real sales point. Feeds
the behavior engine (#6) and the Threat Graph (#8).

### Console capability (their actual moat)

**8. Threat Graph: cross-host lineage and pivoting.**
The control-plane work that makes incidents *track*: file→process→child→network→
persistence nodes (signed hashes as keys) stored server-side, ATT&CK technique nodes,
pivot queries ("what else from this imphash cluster"), process-tree rendering as Falcon
RTR does. Without it, Console incidents are per-sensor event lists; with it, incident
response becomes navigation. Deliverable: `internal/controlplane/graph`, part of Console
Phase A/B.

**9. Standards-native event plane.**
Sensor/console events emitted natively as STIX 2.1 bundles and CAR-shaped objects, with
SIEM sinks (Splunk HEC, Sentinel, Elastic) and OTLP as first-class outputs. Their SaaS
wants the event stream *inside* NG-SIEM; offering the same data to whatever the SOC
already runs removes the main objection to adopting a new console.

**10. Air-gapped-first architecture.**
Fully offline detection updates (signed bundle + manifest, revocation chain), console as
a single on-prem binary, no cloud dependency in any detection path — CI runs an actual
network-isolated integration test. Falcon's disconnected mode is a constrained concession;
for regulated/government buyers, air-gap parity is a hard requirement, and it is a
requirement this architecture was born with.

### FOSS SIEM sink matrix (extends #9)

One event model in, N formats out: every console/sensor sink serializes the same
internal findings object; per-SIEM payload differences are profiles, not divergent
schemas. Drift between them is a CI failure.

- [x] Wazuh — direct Wazuh Manager API forwarder (POST /events with JWT),
      OCSF-identical payload, `cau scan --wazuh-url` et al, free (single-host
      action, licensing rule: only the multi-agent pane is paid). RFC 5424
      syslog + CEF framing stay a follow-on for sites that front Wazuh with a
      log aggregator that prefers them.
- [~] Security Onion — ECS-JSON syslog + a STIX 2.1/TAXII feed. **ECS-in-syslog shipped
      2026-11-06**: `--format syslog-ecs` (RFC 5424 frames whose MSG is the ECS document),
      delivered with `--sink-url tls://…` using RFC 6587 octet counting.
      **STIX export shipped 2026-11-06**: `--format stix` writes one STIX 2.1 bundle per
      run (identity, hash-only indicators, deduplicated attack-patterns, `malware` only
      for a named threat, `indicates` relationships; UUIDv5 ids; the file path never in
      a pattern). Proven by round trip through the engine's own `intake.ParseSTIX` and a
      conformance fixture. **Open:** a TAXII server or push (the bundle is a file), and
      a run against a live Security Onion.
- [~] OpenSearch Security Analytics — OTLP and ECS bulk over HTTP. **Engine side shipped
      2026-11-06**: `--format otlp` (OTLP/JSON logs) and `--format ecs`, delivered with
      `--sink-url https://…` (`/v1/logs`, or `_bulk` with `--sink-index`; a 200 carrying
      `"errors": true` is reported as a failure). **Open:** tested against protocol-level
      fixtures only, not a live OpenSearch; OTLP over gRPC/protobuf is not implemented.
- [~] OSSIM — CEF/LEEF over syslog. **Engine side shipped 2026-11-06**: `--format cef`,
      `leef`, `syslog-cef`, `syslog-leef`, over `udp://`, `tcp://` or `tls://`.
      **Open:** a run against a live OSSIM/QRadar parser.
      All three ride `internal/report/siem.go` (profiles of the one OCSF finding) and
      `internal/forward/collector` (one-shot delivery at the end of a scan, best-effort).
      **Sender seam shipped 2026-11-06**: `collector.NewSender` implements
      `forward.Sender`, so the resident agent's bounded queue can deliver any sink
      format; `report.RenderSinkEvents` renders OCSF finding maps through the same
      event and the same renderers as `cau scan` (byte-identical for file findings,
      tested for all nine formats), and incident fields (peers, PIDs, extra files) have
      a stated home per format. **Open:** no `cau defend` flag uses it yet (that file
      has another owner, who has declined to wire it until asked); before it is wired,
      `Send` must return the wire count rather than counting malformed, oversize and
      refused events as delivered, or the queue's exact accounting becomes untrue;
      process name, command line and peer port are not in the incident envelope, so
      no format carries them; CEF drops file paths after the first.
- [~] Matano — OCSF-JSON (Apache-2.0, the youngest of the five). Engine side shipped
      2026-10-29: `cau scan --format ocsf` writes OCSF 1.3.0 Detection Findings
      (`internal/report/ocsf.go`); the conformance fixture round-trip shipped 2026-11-06
      (below); the console sink remains.
- License-honesty footnote: Graylog (SSPL) and Elastic Security (Elastic License 2.0)
  are widely deployed and supported as sinks, but are not OSI-FOSS — the marketing
  never calls them open source, and the matrix above is what the word means here.
- [x] Conformance fixtures per standard ship with the schemas: one RFC 5424 frame, one
  CEF event, one GELF message, one ECS doc, one OCSF object, one OTLP batch — each
  round-trip-parsed in CI so a sink update cannot silently break ingestion.
  **Shipped 2026-11-06** under `internal/report/testdata/conformance/` (plus one LEEF
  event). `TestSinkConformanceFixtures` regenerates each, compares byte for byte and
  parses it back with a reader written against the standard; a hostile-filename fixture
  proves no line format can be made to emit a second event. Honest limit: the readers
  are ours, not the vendors' parsers, and the RFC 5424 SD-ID uses the documentation
  enterprise number (32473) until a PEN is registered.

### OpenEDR gap analysis — the open benchmark, and the traps not to repeat

OpenEDR (Comodo's open-source EDR) is the only complete open-source EDR codebase
worth benchmarking against. It earns credit for publishing the agent at all — and its
own public surfaces (README architecture, issue #56, issue #40) document gaps that
double as both the wedge list for this plan and the acceptance-criteria traps an
open EDR must not repeat, this one included. Facts stay class-level:

| Gap | Public evidence | CAU's owning row |
|---|---|---|
| Windows-only agent | single-agent docs, no Linux/macOS/CI sensor | Linux-first scope plus the platform rows — the surface no one covers |

- [ ] Same-report parity test: every public OpenEDR vulnerability class — LPE, RCE,
  bugcheck, SYSTEM-exec, telemetry-bypass — maps into the exploit-attempt ledger as a
  fixture requirement. If the same class exists in this sensor, the anti-tamper and
  fuzzing gates must catch it, and the coverage render states the pairing explicitly.
- [~] No-injection build gate: the sensor ships zero injection primitives; CI greps
  the sensor source for injection-pattern APIs as a build gate — the pledge is
  enforced by the build, not by prose.
  **Engine half shipped 2026-11-06** as `TestNoInjectionPrimitives`
  (`source_gates_test.go`, in the race lane): it parses every non-test Go file of the
  engine and fails on a use of ptrace, `process_vm_writev`, `init_module`/`finit_module`,
  `memfd_create`, raw `bpf(2)` or the `plugin` package. It reads the syntax tree, not
  the text, because the detection content is full of those names as patterns. **Open:**
  the same gate over the sensor (`cau-kernel`, a separate repository, whose eBPF
  enforcement legitimately uses `bpf(2)` and needs its own allowlist), and the gate does
  not see a write to `/proc/<pid>/mem` done through ordinary file calls.
- [ ] Measured rivalry: when the third-party scoring gate lands, OpenEDR's policy and
  pattern artifacts run through the same Phase 1 fixtures alongside CAU's own —
  published numbers, not opinions.
- [ ] Fork-lineage audit: whatever the Phase 0 cleanup carried over from the original
  engine, every trap above gets an explicit acceptance-criteria checkbox in the fork's
  follow-up list — inherit the code, never the class of flaw.
- [ ] Respect note: OpenEDR published a working agent when almost nobody would. The
  benchmark's value cuts both ways, and the plan says so rather than dunking.

## Phase 8 — Firmware & boot-chain scanning (the shared blind spot)

Everything above scans what lives on the disk and stops at the OS boundary. Firmware
persistence survives disk wipes, ransomware and bootkits already treat the boot chain as
part of their estate (LoJax, MoonBounce, BlackLotus), and no major EDR publishes its
firmware-scanning layer. This is a wedge, not a parity bet — and honesty about boundaries
is part of the deliverable.

**First surface shipped 2026-11-02** as `scanner/uefi` + the `cau firmware` command
(`cau firmware [--format text|json] [--threshold N] [--implants <file>] <image>`):
it parses a UEFI image's Firmware Volumes and FFS files/sections and reports a module
inventory (GUID, type, UI name, has-PE), the FV header checksum integrity, and
implant-blocklist matches. It is deliberately conservative and ships **no implant truth
set** — firmware is overwhelmingly legitimate PEI/DXE/SMM drivers, so only two classes
score: `uefi.volume-checksum-invalid` (a tampered/hand-built FV header, weight 3) and
`uefi.known-implant-guid` (an operator `--implants` blocklist match, weight 8). Everything
else is inventory; module bodies are not disassembled, compressed/GUIDed sections are not
decompressed, and NVRAM/signatures/boot-policy are not analysed. Adds T1542.001 (System
Firmware) to the coverage matrix (58 → 59 on the baseline re-record). UEFI is its own
command, not part of the per-file `cau scan`. The remaining Phase 8 items below stay open.

- [~] `scanner/uefi` — firmware-volume parser (UEFITool-style FFS/sections). **Core
  shipped** (FV + FFS file/section parse, module inventory, FV checksum, implant
  blocklist). Still open: feeding each executable section through the YARA ruleset and
  decompressing GUIDed/compressed sections.
  **2026-11-06, three changes, measured on the 11 OVMF images Debian ships:**
  (1) *Bug fixed:* the file walk treated a pad file (all-0xFF name, which edk2 places
  first in every volume with an extended header) as free space and stopped, so the
  inventory was 0-1 modules on every stock image. (2) *LZMA sections are opened*
  (`scanner/uefi/lzma.go`, an in-tree bounded decoder since the standard library has
  none; 64 MiB per section, 256 MiB per image, nesting depth 4, fuzzed) and nested
  volumes are walked, including plain FIRMWARE_VOLUME_IMAGE sections: inventory now
  91-156 modules on each of the eight code images (the three variable stores hold no
  drivers), about 0.2 s each. (3) *Executable sections go through the
  YARA ruleset* in `cau firmware` (`uefi.module-rule-match`, weight 8; `--rules`,
  `--no-yara`): 0 hits over 1,079 module bodies. **Open:** the EFI/Tiano compression
  and other GUID-defined encodings (counted and reported as not opened); the bundled
  rules target OS malware, so "no hit" on firmware says little until firmware-specific
  rules and the fixture corpus row below exist; the zero-hit figure is one firmware
  family, not a vendor-firmware FP rate.
- [~] UEFI anomaly surfaces: option ROM inventory, WPBT/ACPI table scan (WPBT is a
  vendor-approved injection primitive), EFI boot-order/entry tampering (where BlackLotus
  lives), efivarfs read-only inventory, DBX/SBAT/MOK revocation state checked against
  current UEFI Forum revocation releases.
  **Inventory half shipped 2026-11-06** inside `cau boot-scan`: PCI option ROMs (presence
  and size only, because sysfs maps a ROM only after a write), the WPBT table and ACPI
  table names, boot entries and order with dangling/missing-target checks, Secure Boot
  and setup-mode state, dbx/db/MOK sizes and the SBAT level, and a dbx comparison against
  an operator-supplied reference file (`--dbx-reference`).
  **Signed baseline shipped 2026-11-06:** `cau boot-scan --record / --check`
  (`internal/bootscan/baseline.go`, `compare.go`) with optional Ed25519 signing. It
  compares boot entries and order, Secure Boot state, PK/KEK/db/dbx/MOK digests, SBAT
  levels, ESP binaries, disk boot code and partition tables, ACPI tables, option ROMs
  and firmware versions; only security-relevant differences fail, a dbx that only grew
  or a firmware version that rose is "expected with updates", and what could not be
  re-read is `not-reverified`, never "removed". With `--pubkey`, an unsigned or
  tampered baseline or an unusable key fails the run. Measured: 10 checks on one host
  within one boot, 0 differences. **Open:** stability across reboots is unmeasured;
  SBAT and MOK are not checked against published revocation levels; the reference dbx
  is operator-supplied; dbx growth is judged by counts plus a digest; `BootNext` is
  not recorded; ROM and WPBT contents are not read.
- [x] `cau boot-scan` — OSS, strictly read-only: local ESP scan + firmware capsule/EFIVAR
  inventory, MBR/VBR/GPT sanity check (Petya-class bootkit coverage). Hard boundary: the
  engine never images or flashes live chips; SPI/eSPI work stays with opt-in operator
  tooling (chipsec-class), documented but not automated.
  **Shipped 2026-11-06** as `internal/bootscan` + `cmd_bootscan.go`. Disks (`--disk`):
  MBR, GPT primary and backup headers with both CRC32s, per-partition boot sectors;
  classes for a boot-area ransom note (the only one that crosses the threshold alone), a
  destroyed primary GPT with an intact backup, CRC failures, primary/backup disagreement,
  overlaps, an ESP that is not FAT. ESP: every EFI binary with digest, PE subsystem and
  signature presence; unsigned binaries score only when Secure Boot is enabled. Read-only
  is enforced by `TestPackageNeverWrites`, which parses the package source. Two fuzz
  targets in `make fuzz`. Measured so far only on synthetic images and one real host
  (0 scored findings); no benign-population FP number yet, and its techniques
  (T1542.001/.002/.003, T1561.002, T1486, T1553.006) are not yet rows in `cau coverage`.
- [~] Firmware-image bulk scanning at the scan node: router/NAS/IoT/vendor images with
  binwalk-style unpack (squashfs, jffs2, cramfs) recursed into the normal detectors —
  LOLDrivers, HijackLibs and bootloaders.io intake already supply the hashes and rules.
  **Container identification and extraction shipped 2026-11-10** as `scanner/firmware` +
  `cau firmware scan`: the image is searched for the container formats a device image
  actually holds (squashfs, cramfs, jffs2, ext2/3/4, FAT, gzip, zip, tar, xz, zstd, LZMA,
  uImage, ISO — a tar's "ustar" sits 257 bytes in, an ext superblock's magic 1080, so the
  container's own start is found, not guessed), the members of gzip, zip and tar are
  extracted, and the ordinary detectors run over them like any other file. A container
  this build cannot open is reported with its offset and the reason it was not opened —
  never as an empty result, because an image whose filesystem was not unpacked is an
  image nothing was measured in. The extraction is bounded (members, per-member bytes
  and total bytes). **Open:** squashfs, cramfs and jffs2 are identified but not opened —
  their metadata blocks need decoders this build does not carry (squashfs in particular
  may use zstd), so those images still need an extractor, and "identified" is not
  "inspected".
- [~] Sensor surface (console side): efivarfs watch, kernel-taint and
  `module.sig_enforce` state as behavior-engine telemetry; persistence-info catalog as
  the cross-check list.
  **The kernel-state half shipped 2026-11-10** as `internal/bootscan/kernel.go` and
  `cau boot-scan --proc`: the taint word, the module signature enforcement mode and the
  module count, read from a proc root and reported as state rather than as a finding (a
  permissive signature mode is a policy question the operator owns). The taint table is
  the same one the kernel sensor (`cau-kernel`) decodes with, so the two agree on what
  a flag means; an unknown taint bit is reported as `taint-bit-<n>` rather than
  dropped. **Open:** the efivarfs *watch* — efivarfs is not an inotify-capable
  filesystem, so a watch over it is a poll, and the poll's interval and its cost are
  not settled; the persistence-info catalog is console-side.
- [ ] Fixture corpus with the Phase 1 gates intact: public UEFI/BIOS implant fixtures and
  rule packs (LoJax/MoonBounce-class), measured for FP/FN like any other detection
  content. Firmware rules have a small-n truth set — say so in their model cards rather
  than inflating recall claims.
  **Declined here, on purpose:** the corpus policy says fixtures are synthetic and
  generated at eval time, never built from real samples, and the public LoJax- and
  MoonBounce-class artifacts are real malware. Shipping them would break that rule for
  the sake of a benchmark. What the engine ships instead is the synthetic firmware
  corpus the UEFI parser is measured on, and the operator's own images through
  `cau firmware scan` — with the boundary stated rather than papered over.

## Phase 9 — Blind-spot sweep (what this plan had been missing)

- [~] Linux-native ELF detection — the top non-firmware gap. **Engine half shipped
  2026-10-25**: own ELF parser and anomaly classes in `scanner/static` (RWX / packed
  segments, stripped section tables, interpreter and `RPATH` hijack, `dlsym`-resolving
  libc interposers, loader-only imports, kernel-module signature and `modinfo` state,
  malformed tables), ELF imports in the heuristics pass with a Kernel Rootkit category,
  measured at 0 detections on 4,999 Kali ELF files. **Deep-resolution shipped
  2026-11-02** (`scanner/static/elf_reloc.go` + edits): `.init_array`/
  `.preinit_array` constructor-pointer targets are resolved through the
  relocations and a pointer landing outside executable code flags
  `dynamic.init-array-outside-code`; symbol versions are read from
  `.gnu.version_r`/`_d` (`dynamic.symbol-versions`, informational); a raw-syscall
  libc interposer flags `dynamic.preload-interposer-syscall`; and real
  **telfhash** (TLSH over the Trend Micro filtered symbol set) is computed, with
  an honest note when the binary is below TLSH's 50-byte floor. **Still open**
  (content, not parser): syscall-stub templates, SSH/cron tamper patterns and
  autostart paths. The pass is no longer "a PE-only engine behind a Linux CLI".
  **Content shipped 2026-11-07** (`scanner/static/elf_content.go`), six classes:
  `content.direct-syscalls` (T1106: a *dynamically linked* image carrying raw
  `syscall` stubs for sensitive calls whose libc wrapper it does not export, decoded
  from the `mov eax/rax, imm` before the instruction, x86-64 only; statically linked
  Go/Rust/busybox images are exempt by construction), `content.ssh-authorized-key` and
  `content.sshd-config-edit` (T1098.004), `content.cron-job` (T1053.003),
  `content.systemd-unit` (T1543.002) and `content.autostart-multi` (T1547), each
  needing a location *and* a payload body (a key, a directive set to yes, a crontab
  line, a unit body), never a path string alone. A new `Persistence` category is capped
  at 6, so content alone cannot cross the static threshold of 8. **Measured** on every
  ELF under /usr/bin, /usr/sbin, /usr/lib and /usr/libexec (11,519 files, 10,928
  dynamically linked): static detections 6 before and 6 after (the same six firmware
  blobs), suspicious verdicts 19 and 19, exactly one file with any difference
  (`/usr/bin/podman` gained the weight-2 `content.systemd-unit` observation; it does
  install user units), 0 hits on any of the Kali offensive tools present, about +2 %
  CPU over 10.3 GB. **Open:** i386 (`int 0x80`) and aarch64 (`svc`) number decoding,
  not shipped because this machine holds no benign population of either to measure
  on; `mov edi,N; call syscall@plt` stubs; the per-file marker and syscall tables are
  in the result but not yet in the scan reports.
  GTFOBins/GTFOArgs intake is behavior content, not
  binary content — without this, the eBPF sensor (#Phase 7-7) is telemetry with no local
  verifier.
- [x] Mach-O structural pass — **shipped 2026-11-02** as `scanner/static/macho.go`
  (+ `macho_anomaly.go`, catalog `fmtMachO`): own bounds-checked parser for thin
  and universal/fat images, 32- and 64-bit, both byte orders. Reads segments and
  sections (permissions, entropy), linked dylibs and a dylib-set import hash,
  `LC_RPATH`, the `LC_MAIN`/`LC_UNIXTHREAD` entry point, code-signature presence
  (`LC_CODE_SIGNATURE`, unverified), encryption (`LC_ENCRYPTION_INFO` cryptid),
  and symbol imports/exports. Anomaly classes (`macho.*`): universal, RWX and
  high-entropy segments, writable-executable section, entry outside/non-exec
  segment, executable stack, encrypted/packed region, insecure rpath/dylib path,
  unsigned or unverified signature, overlay. Scanner result carries
  `is_macho`/`macho`, surfaced through `internal/report` (static `is_macho` +
  `macho` object; `telfhash`/`telfhash_note`/`syscall_stubs` on the `elf` object).
- [~] Document & archive vectors: OLE (VBA, macro stomping, remote templates), PDF, LNK,
  CHM, ISO; nested-decompression budget with bomb caps. These are the top delivery paths.
  **All five document formats now ship** (LNK, OLE, PDF, ISO on 2026-10-30; CHM on
  2026-11-02 — detail below). The shared
  **nested-decompression bomb-cap budget shipped 2026-11-02** as `scanner/archive`
  — bounded ZIP/TAR/gzip (+tar.gz) container-hygiene analysis (decompression bombs
  via ratio + absolute caps, Zip-Slip/path-traversal, double-extension lures,
  disguised single-executable and nested/encrypted members), wired into the engine,
  fusion and all four reporters with `--no-archive` / `--archive-threshold`. In the
  coverage matrix as the `archive` source (T1036 / T1204.002 / T1027 on already-covered
  rows — no new techniques, count stays 58).
  **LNK shipped 2026-10-30** as `scanner/lnk` ([MS-SHLLINK] parser + detection, wired
  through the engine, fusion, ATT&CK coverage and all four reporters; `--no-lnk` /
  `--lnk-threshold`; adds coverage of T1204.002 and the T1059 family / T1027 from
  shortcuts). **OLE shipped 2026-10-30** as `scanner/ole` ([MS-CFB] parser + [MS-OVBA]
  decompression + VBA-macro detection, wired the same way; `--no-ole` / `--ole-threshold`;
  adds coverage of T1137 and T1203 and joins T1105 / T1027 / the T1059 family /
  T1204.002). Go-native, no sidecar needed. Macro-stomping was deferred (needs the
  MODULEOFFSET dir-record parse; the v1 signature-scan locates CompressedContainers
  without it — measure-or-don't-ship). **Macro-stomping detection shipped 2026-11-06,
  conservatively** (`scanner/ole/vbadir.go`, `stomp.go`; T1564.007): a bounded parser
  for the VBA `dir` stream splits each module at its text offset into compiled p-code
  and source, and three classes report an inconsistency between them:
  `ole.vba.stomp.source-missing` (5), `source-blank` (4) and `mismatch` (2, a heuristic
  over string runs in the p-code, not a disassembly). No class crosses the threshold on
  structure alone; a module with p-code and no source needs the string corroboration.
  That caution is the measurement: this machine has 39 OLE2 files of which 6 carry a
  VBA project (18 modules, three of the six from exploit-framework data), 0 stomping
  findings and no change in any verdict, which is far too few to state a false-positive
  rate. **Open for this part:** a real benign Office corpus to set the weights; source
  replaced by harmless text is only a sub-threshold observation. **OOXML reached
  2026-11-07** (`scanner/archive/ooxml.go`): a `.docm`/`.xlsm`/`.pptm` zip is recognised
  (`ooxml-word/-excel/-powerpoint`), its `vbaProject.bin` member is opened under a
  16 MiB cap and run through the OLE pass with the OLE weights, stomping included; the
  findings carry an `archive.ooxml.` prefix and a `via` member, and the module table is
  in the report as `embedded_vba` (JSON schema 1.13.0). Remote-template injection
  (T1221, `archive.ooxml.remote-template`, weight 6: an `attachedTemplate` relationship
  with an http/https/file-host target; UNC and local paths are not findings) is new.
  Measured on the 307 OOXML files on this host: all recognised, 0 findings, but none of
  them carries a VBA project or a settings relationship, so there is no false-positive
  measurement for the carried classes or the template check beyond the 39-OLE-file
  figure above; a real benign macro-document corpus is still the open item. The engine
  does not yet pass `--ole-threshold` into the embedded pass (`scanner/engine.go`, one
  line, another session's file today). **PDF shipped 2026-10-30** as `scanner/pdf`
  (bounded lexical scan with `#xx` name de-obfuscation + malicious-document detection,
  wired the same way; `--no-pdf` / `--pdf-threshold`; adds coverage of T1059.007 and
  T1204.001 and joins T1027 / T1059 / T1105 / T1204.002). **ISO shipped 2026-10-30** as
  `scanner/iso` (bounded, cycle-safe ISO 9660 + Joliet directory enumeration reading the
  mark-of-the-web-bypass smuggling shape; `--no-iso` / `--iso-threshold`; adds coverage of
  T1091, takes T1564.001 to *partial* — the ISO-container hidden-payload facet; the
  host-filesystem facet is still the Phase 11 sensor row — and joins T1204.002). **CHM
  shipped 2026-11-02** as `scanner/chm`: it walks the uncompressed ITSF/ITSP/PMGL
  directory and scores embedded payloads a help file has no reason to carry — a lone
  embedded PE (`chm.embedded-executable`, crosses on its own), multiple executables, an
  embedded `.lnk`, and dangerous scripts (`.hta`/`.vbs`/`.ps1`/`.bat`/`.cmd`/`.wsf`, not
  plain `.js`); `--no-chm` / `--chm-threshold`; T1204.002 / T1059. The LZX content
  section is still not decompressed, so the `<OBJECT>` ShortCut/WinExec tradecraft inside
  compressed topics is "present but not inspected" rather than guessed — the embedded-
  payload shape (the high-signal one) ships now; the LZX work is the honest remaining
  gap. Each shipped parser lands with its own fuzz harness (see the parser-fuzzing gate).
- [x] Quarantine + canary primitives in the OSS engine: quarantine DB with
  integrity-checked restore, decoy/canary files as cheap ground truth for the behavior
  engine. Prevention is free: full on-host response (quarantine, restore, block, kill)
  ships in the engine/agent, not behind the paywall — the console only *manages* it
  across many agents. Today the engine already has an honest place to put found files.
  **Shipped 2026-11-02.** `internal/quarantine` is a directory-backed vault
  (`cau quarantine add|list|restore|verify|delete`): every entry is XOR-masked at
  rest — never a runnable PE/ELF on disk, never re-flagged by a scanner pointed at the
  vault — and sealed with the SHA-256 of both the original and the masked bytes, so a
  corrupted or tampered vault fails *closed* (`ErrIntegrity`, exit 1) instead of writing
  wrong bytes back onto the live path; index writes are atomic (temp + rename). Add
  moves by default, `--keep` copies. `internal/canary` plants decoy files
  (`cau canary plant`) with a recorded baseline and diffs them (`cau canary check`),
  classifying each as intact / modified / deleted / meta-changed — a rewrite (the
  ransomware signal) is never conflated with a mere permission change. The engine stays
  honest that `check` is a point-in-time comparison a cron job or task hook runs, not a
  live watch (that is the sensor's job). Both ship with full unit + end-to-end CLI tests.
  **Scan-time prevention wired 2026-11-02:** `cau scan --quarantine` moves every
  MALICIOUS-verdict file into the vault in the same pass that found it — detect *and*
  prevent, free, in the OSS engine. Explicit and off by default (destructive); the
  high-confidence tier only (hash/YARA), never sub-threshold suspicions.
- [ ] Container/OCI registry scanning at the scan node: registry-native pull scanning +
  a Kubernetes admission hook. A large share of the market's code ships inside images;
  the engine currently sees that content only after unpack, if ever.
- [~] Post-quantum signature chain (ML-DSA or hybrid) for air-gapped update bundles +
  reproducible builds and SBOMs for released artifacts. Extends Phase 7 items 1 and 10
  before cryptography forces the migration, not after.
  **Classical signature chain shipped 2026-11-02:** Ed25519-signed update bundles and
  release `SHA256SUMS` (`cau bundle`/`cau update`/`cau verify-self`), with the air-gapped
  path (`--from` a signed directory delivered by media) already working.
  **SBOMs shipped 2026-11-06:** `cau bundle sbom [--binary <path>]` writes a CycloneDX 1.5
  document from the build information embedded in the binary (the modules actually
  linked, with their go.sum hashes), with no timestamp or serial so it is reproducible;
  the release job writes one per binary before `SHA256SUMS` is signed. It states its own
  gap: cgo-linked libyara and libc are not Go modules and are not listed.
  **Hybrid post-quantum signatures implemented 2026-11-06:** `cau bundle keygen --hybrid`
  makes an Ed25519 + ML-DSA-65 key (`crypto/mldsa`, FIPS 204); `cau bundle
  update/checksums` sign with it, and `cau update` / `cau verify-self` require both
  signatures when the trusted key is hybrid, refuse an Ed25519-only signature under a
  hybrid key (the strip-the-PQ-half downgrade), and verify Ed25519-only releases under
  Ed25519 keys exactly as before (pinned by tests using signatures made the old way).
  The ML-DSA half is domain-separated per artifact type by the FIPS 204 context string.
  Encodings and the both-required rule are tested, fuzzed and mutation-checked (11
  mutants, all killed); there has been no outside review.
  **Open, and the first one is a decision:** `go.mod` and CI are on Go 1.24 and
  `crypto/mldsa` needs 1.27, so the ML-DSA code sits behind a build tag and a CI-built
  binary refuses hybrid keys. Hybrid releases need Go >= 1.27 in CI (and then in the
  Debian and RPM build requirements), a hybrid key generated and stored, and the
  release job taught to sign with it. Also open: the `cau selftest` baseline signature
  is Ed25519-only; several trusted keys for rotation (with the hazard that a set holding
  an Ed25519 key and a hybrid key sharing its Ed25519 half re-opens the downgrade);
   hosts that pin only the Ed25519 key gain nothing; SLSA provenance attestations.
   **Decision (2026-11-07): the Go 1.27 bump (which would switch released binaries
   from Ed25519-only to hybrid ML-DSA-65 signatures) is HELD.** `go.mod`'s
   `go 1.24.1` plus CI (`.github/actions/cau-env/action.yml` follows go.mod) keep CI
   binaries at 1.24; the hybrid code already sits behind `//go:build go1.27 &&
   !nomldsa` and a 1.24 binary refuses hybrid keys cleanly, so holding breaks
   nothing. Bumping would need `debian/control` `golang-go (>= 2:1.27~)`, but the
   package.yml Debian leg builds in debian:trixie, whose golang-go is a 1.24-line
   package (that leg fails unless CI is reworked to fetch a 1.27 toolchain), and
   `packaging/rpm/cau.spec` would need `BuildRequires: golang >= 1.27`, unverifiable
   because the spec has never been built on an RPM distribution; hybrid signing is
   also new and has had no outside review. Revisit when: an RPM build is verified,
   package.yml installs a 1.27 toolchain, and a hybrid release-signing key workflow
   exists.
   **Reproducibility check shipped 2026-11-06:** a `reproducible` CI lane copies the
  checkout to two directories of different depth, builds both binaries in each and fails
  on any difference; the release job needs it. Run locally with the same steps: `cau` and
  `cau-mcp` came out byte-identical. It compares two builds on one runner with one
  toolchain; it does not show that a different machine or distribution reproduces them.
- [ ] Parser fuzzing gate: OSS-Fuzz/libFuzzer harnesses for every shipped parser (PE,
  ELF, UEFI, OLE, archives). A scanner that dies on a malformed sample is a
  time-of-scanning liability; fuzz failures block releases with the same honesty as the
  Phase 1 gates.
  Progress: **every parser shipped so far is fuzzed** — `FuzzParsePE`,
  `FuzzParseELF`, `FuzzAnalyze` (static), `FuzzScan` (stego),
  `FuzzScanHeuristicsData`, `FuzzAnalyze` (encchain), `FuzzAnalyze` (lnk),
  `FuzzAnalyze` (ole, the [MS-CFB] + [MS-OVBA] parsers), `FuzzAnalyze` (pdf) and
  `FuzzAnalyze` (iso, the ISO 9660 enumerator), all in `make fuzz` with seed
  corpora that also run as fast unit tests under `make test`. The item stays
  open for the parsers not yet written (UEFI → Phase 8, CHM → Phase 9, pending
  its LZX decompressor); each lands with its fuzz harness in the same change.
- [ ] macOS decision, explicitly: Mach-O scanner plus the LOOBins content already
  ingested. Scope is set at the end of Phase 2 — OSS engine only, or console sensor
  surface. The one thing not accepted is drifting half-committed for two releases.

## Phase 10 — Novel-technique detections (ahead of ATT&CK)

A detection-first catalog of techniques observed in the ArcticFox research corpus that
have no MITRE mapping *(fittingly, no detection analytic either)* — the standard EDR
blind-spot problem, but enumerated from exploits rather than folklore. The repo publishes
detections and synthetic fixtures, never the source implementation: readers get what to
catch and how to catch it, not how to build it. This Phase 4-connected work maps into
`frameworks` and its ATT&CK submission drafts continue there.

| ID | Technique | Detection focus | MITRE |
|---|---|---|---|
| NOVEL-001 | Zero-width Unicode steg in text/code artifacts (README dead-drop C2) | presence-based: any zero-width codepoint in distributable text/code, excepted only by package provenance | T1027.018 (partial) |
| NOVEL-002 | AEAD-encrypt-then-ZW-encode C2 pipeline | covered by the same detector — catch the codepoint class, not the chain | none |
| NOVEL-003 | Port-shared bind shell (SO_REUSEPORT) coexisting with a real listener | per-port binder reconciliation: kernel socket-group membership vs the port's expected service owner | none |
| NOVEL-004 | Watchdog respawn with rotating process names | correlate by executable hash and endpoints, not argv; respawn-chain graph alert | T1036 (partial) |
| NOVEL-005 | In-host anti-competitor malware sweep | kill-events matching known-malware name pools — dual IOA: implant present, or an exclusive-tenancy war | none |
| NOVEL-006 | ZW-encoded heartbeat relayed through open-redirect URLs | egress checks for zero-width/non-printable bytes in URL query params | T1001.003 (partial) |
| NOVEL-007 | `LD_AUDIT`-based library-load interception | `ld.so.preload` / `LD_AUDIT` inventory reconciled with package provenance; auditor SOs must be instrumentation | none |
| NOVEL-008 | fanotify listener event suppression | fanotify listener registration + ignored-mask grants vs package provenance | none |
| NOVEL-009 | systemd generator unit injection | generator inventory vs provenance; diff transient units under `/run/systemd/generator` | none (T1543 family gap) |
| NOVEL-010 | eBPF filtering of the audit subsystem | in-kernel BPF program attach inventory on audit/lsm hooks; anything not fleet-pinned alerts | none |
| NOVEL-011 | CRIU checkpoint/restore process resurrection | checkpoint-image monitor + restore-invocation tracing + exec-less lineage anomaly alert | none |
| NOVEL-012 | Multi-method obfuscation chaining in binaries (encoding→packing→encryption stacks, depth as a signal) | chain-depth estimator + bounded peeling pipeline + peel-exhausted honest states; runtime unpack taps as the sensor-side complement | T1027 family (partial) |
| NOVEL-013 | Script-level multi-encoding chains (eval loops, macro-stomp + remote-template + encoded-payload stacks) | script-AST transformation capture through the chain — the normalized final-call surface, not the raw text | T1027 + T1059 family (partial) |

- [x] Engine-side zero-width codepoint detector for text and code artifacts — shipped
  2026-10-25 as `scanner/stego` (the engine's detectors live under `scanner/`, not
  `internal/`), surfaced as `ScanResult.Stego`, the `stego` eval detector, JSON schema
  1.2.0, SARIF `stego/<class>` rules with byte-offset regions, and `--no-stego` /
  `--stego-threshold`. Presence-based, as this row demands, with a *closed* list of
  context exceptions each named in the report: BOM at offset 0, emoji ZWJ sequences and
  presentation selectors, joiners beside joining scripts, ZWSP beside spaceless scripts
  (Khmer, Thai, Lao, Myanmar, Tibetan), directional controls on a line holding RTL text,
  CJK variation sequences, subdivision-flag TAG sequences. Classes beyond zero-width:
  bidi controls (Trojan Source), TAG characters, data-carrying variation selectors.
  Measured: 69 detections on 70,200 benign text artifacts from Kali's `/usr/share/doc`
  and `/usr/lib/python3/dist-packages` (0.10 % FP; stray pasted U+200B in docs and
  translation files, and Unicode-table source such as xregexp / jinja2), 0 on the 294
  text files in `/usr/share/windows-resources`, 35,187 legitimate uses excused by the
  rules above. The Khmer and RTL rules were added *because of* that measurement (they
  removed 9 + 8 false positives); nothing else was tuned. A YARA module cannot back
  this detector in go-yara without C, and a byte-pattern rule for the UTF-8 of U+200D
  would fire on every family emoji, so the Go detector is the single implementation
  and the YARA-module idea is dropped. Console still adds the egress URL check.
- [~] Sensor-side rules in `internal/behavior` for the host techniques: binder
  reconciliation, respawn-chain graphs, kill-pool matching, fanotify/generator/BPF
  inventories, CRIU restore tracing. Provenance (Debian/etc., per Phase 7 #5) is the
  benign anchor for all five inventory checks.
  **The inventory half shipped 2026-11-10** as `internal/behavior`, run by the
  resident agent (`cau defend`): the auditor-library inventory (LD_AUDIT /
  LD_PRELOAD, reconciled with the package database), the fanotify inventory (the
  listener, and the mask it asked not to be told about), the systemd generator
  inventory, and the pinned BPF program inventory. Provenance is the benign
  anchor for all four, and the layer says so when there is no package database:
  the inventories are then published without an anchor rather than presented as
  clean. The classes are state, not proof, and sit below the response threshold.
  **Open:** the binder reconciliation (NOVEL-003), the respawn-chain graph
  (NOVEL-004), the kill-pool matching (NOVEL-005) and the CRIU restore tracing
  (NOVEL-011) — the three that need a history the host does not keep by itself
  (who bound the port, which process was respawned by which, which names were
  killed, which process was restored from a checkpoint image). They need the
  kernel guard's event log and a time series rather than a point reading, which
  is a different shape of rule than an inventory.
- [ ] Phase 6 ties: each technique becomes a fixed regression case in the evasion-report
  suite, executed against the corpus.
- [ ] Fixtures are generated synthetic samples (corpus policy: nothing sensitive is
  committed); every detector ships with FP/FN numbers through the Phase 1 gates.
- [~] `frameworks` gains a `novel: NOVEL-xxx` field beside the ATT&CK/UKC/MISP IDs, and
  each technique family is drafted as an ATT&CK submission with detection strategies —
  the honest path for detection-first research to be upstreamed. Started: stego findings
  and fusion evidence carry `novel` (NOVEL-001) beside `technique` (T1027) in JSON and
  SARIF; the full `frameworks` object and the submission drafts remain Phase 4 work.
- [x] `internal/peeler`: bounded unpeeling pipeline walking the candidate *tree* via
  parallel unwrap (the DoS design below). Over-cap yields a `peel-exhausted` outcome
  routed to emulation fallback — an honest result rendered first-class — never
  silent-clean.
  **First increment shipped 2026-11-02.** `internal/peeler` + `cau peel`: a bounded,
  concurrent tree walk where every applicable reversible layer decoder (base64/base32/
  hex, gzip/zlib/flate/bzip2 — decode only, never execute) spawns a child, under one
  **global per-sample budget** shared across every branch (nodes, decoded bytes, depth,
  frontier width, wall clock), so adding layers adds latency, not spend. `peel-exhausted`
  is a first-class, scored outcome (never silent clean). A revealed payload is a finding
  only at depth >= 2 (a *chain*); a single ordinary layer is `scanner/encchain`'s job, so
  the two divide the work without double-counting benign compression. Measured
  **0 / 116,201 benign files** flagged (`/usr/bin`, `/usr/share/doc`,
  `/usr/lib/python3`, `/usr/share/nmap`); depth-sweep and bomb-cap tests plus `FuzzPeel`
  (in `make fuzz`) back it. **Scan-path wiring shipped 2026-11-02 (second increment):**
  the peeler is now a first-class engine detector — `ScanResult.Peel`, a `peeler` fusion
  source, `--no-peel` / `--peel-threshold` (default on), the `peel` / `peel_*` fields
  across text / JSON (schema 1.9.0) / SARIF / OCSF, and `peeler` content in the ATT&CK
  coverage matrix (T1027, three classes). Measured safe: the eval gate is unchanged
  (recall / precision / FP / FN flat) and a repo self-scan flagged 0 of 291 files.
  **Open follow-ons:** the emulation-sidecar fallback and per-tenant fairness (the
  entropy estimator below shipped 2026-11-02).
- [~] Chain-depth estimator as a cheap pre-pass: entropy-segment profiling plus
  structural fingerprints (overlay chains, packed-import tables, section anomalies)
  route samples to specialized peelers (archive / packer / script) before full peel cost
  is paid. Depth itself is a signal: layer counts above a threshold raise the score
  regardless of the payload verdict, so a chain that outlives the gate still flags.
  Provenance reconciles benign packers — nested packers inside official packages don't
  alert, the same FP rule as everything else.
  Shipped 2026-11-02 (`internal/peeler/estimator.go`): a Shannon-entropy + printable-
  fraction profile ranks the detecting unwrappers per node so the bounded frontier is
  spent on the most-probable transform first (magic-bearing compression over a text
  encoding over headerless flate), and the root entropy rides on the result. Ranking
  only reorders — it never drops a branch or changes a verdict, so the 0-FP envelope and
  depth-sweep detections are unchanged (re-measured 0 / 116,201). Depth-as-signal scoring
  was already in the core increment. **Open:** PE/ELF structural fingerprints (overlay
  chains, packed-import tables) to route to specialized peelers, and provenance
  reconciliation of benign packers (needs the Phase 7 provenance DB).
  **2026-11-06:** a zip magic now routes to the container peeler, and archive members
  are ranked by a cheap peek (encoding token, long base64 run, other text) before any
  is read whole, so the budget reaches the likely member first. **Open:** PE/ELF
  structural fingerprints (the section-table parser is in `scanner/static`, which the
  peeler cannot import) and the provenance attenuation (Phase 7 DB).
- [~] Chain-signature model: each peel records the ordered transformation set it
  removed; ordered chain patterns become family signatures — the multi-layer equivalent
  of a hash — and enter the same detection-content lifecycle with model cards.
  Shipped: each peel records its ordered transform set and renders a stable
  `PrimarySignature` (e.g. `base64>gzip>base64`). Open: promoting recurring signatures
  into the detection-content lifecycle with model cards.
  **2026-11-06:** signatures carry `zip` and `Result.DeepestSignature` names the deepest
  path. **Open:** promoting signatures into a content lifecycle with model cards; there
  is no lifecycle object yet.
- [ ] Emulation-sidecar fallback (Phase 5 runtime): peel-stalled samples run
  unpack-then-scan in the isolated sidecar — snapshot memory, scan the unpacked image,
  same budget caps as static peel.
- [ ] Sensor complement in `internal/behavior`: runtime unpack behavior taps — large
  writable→RX transitions, write-then-execute patterns, self-decryption loops. A chain
  that defeats static peeling meets telemetry that doesn't care how many layers were
  applied.
- [~] Eval-time synthetic chains: the Phase 1 generator *composes* its own
  obfuscation-path library into randomized chains for blue/red fixtures. Depth-swept
  FP/FN must stay flat as depth grows, and multi-layer fixtures land in CI as
  regression cases.
  Shipped in the peeler's own tests: a `compose` helper stacks the layer library over
  an inert payload and the depth-sweep test asserts FP/FN stay flat 1..6 layers against
  a benign twin. Open: folding the composer into the Phase 1 eval generator so the
  chains run through the corpus gates, not only the package's unit tests.
  **2026-11-06:** a randomised composer over the whole layer library (bases, radix
  bases, seven substitutions, gzip/zlib, zip) depth-swept 1..8 with blue/red twins
  runs in the package tests (`chains_test.go`): 0 FN and 0 FP over 192 chains each;
  it found and fixed one real miss (a trial window cut mid-group made long base85
  tokens undecodable). **Open:** folding the composer into `internal/eval`'s generator
  so chains pass the corpus gates; nothing was written under `corpus/`.
- [x] Peel-as-tree, not peel-as-chain: each layer's candidate continuations spawn as
  bounded speculative tasks on a work-stealing pool. The budget wall — cpu-ms, allocated
  bytes, syscall counts, wall-clock — is *global per sample*, shared across every
  branch: an attacker adds depth, not spend, and where the budget goes is the engine's
  choice, not the sample content's.
  Shipped: children spawn on a bounded worker pool (semaphore; a full pool runs the
  child inline, the deadlock-free bounded-recursion pattern) and the `Budget` is one
  shared atomic accounting struct across every branch. The wall tracks nodes, decoded
  bytes, depth, frontier width and wall-clock; cpu-ms/syscall accounting is not yet a
  wall (wall-clock bounds time-to-verdict instead).
- [x] Estimator-guided task graph: the chain-depth estimator ranks the frontier;
  low-probability branches queue last and are cancelled mid-run when the budget counter
  passes its floor. A cancel carries its reason — "peel-exhausted (budget), branch-cancel
  at layer N" is a labeled outcome, not a generic failure.
  **Shipped 2026-11-06:** once any wall is within 1/8 of its limit, a branch from a
  speculative layer (cipher, carve, raw flate) is cancelled instead of opened and the
  peel says so. Engaged on 0 of 131,253 benign files and 0 of 1,645 archives (the
  benign maxima were 14 of 512 nodes and 31 of 64 MiB). Caveat: the time floor can
  drop a speculative branch slightly before the deadline would have.
- [x] Wall-clock bounded by construction: speculative parallel unwrap caps
  time-to-verdict regardless of chain design — a stall-shaped chain burns its own
  budget, not the scan queue. Queue-level DoS dies at this row.
  Shipped: a per-sample wall-clock deadline is checked cooperatively at every node and
  latched as the exhaustion reason; `FuzzPeel` asserts termination within the budget.
- [ ] CPU honesty, stated plainly: parallelism reduces latency, not cost — aggregate
  CPU per sample can rise. The DoS boundary is the budget wall plus fairness; the plan
  does not pretend the tree buys a free lunch.
- [ ] Per-source fairness: tenant-level token buckets on the scan queue — a flood from
  one tenant can never consume the fleet's peel capacity. Ties to the multi-tenancy
  pricing row.
- [x] Content-addressed dedupe: peel artifacts land in a CAS keyed by blob hash — a
  repeated identical chain costs O(1) after its first peel, and the duplicates-flood
  vector amortizes to nothing.
  Shipped: an in-peel `seen` set keyed by SHA-256 skips any sub-blob already visited
  (unit-tested via two transforms that produce the same child). A persistent cross-scan
  CAS stays a follow-on.
- [x] Bounded task-graph invariants: max in-flight children per node, no unbounded
  queues, workers die on budget exhaustion, cancellation is cooperative. These are
  asserted by Phase 1 conformance tests, not just documented.
  Shipped in the peeler: frontier width is capped per node (`MaxChildren`), the worker
  pool is a fixed-size semaphore (no unbounded queue), and cancellation is cooperative
  (context + budget checks at every node). The invariants are asserted by the package's
  own tests; promoting them to the Phase 1 conformance suite is the open part.
  **Shipped 2026-11-06** as code and tests (`invariants.go`): gauges for workers,
  branches per node, nodes, kept bytes and bytes held (ceiling 2x the output wall;
  a decode that would pass it is refused and the peel says so); `checkInvariants`
  runs after every walk and latches a violation as the exhaustion reason; nine
  hostile shapes at 1/3/8 workers, each check shown to fail when its bound is
  broken, and the fuzz target asserts them. **Open:** the checks live on an
  unexported method; a conformance suite outside the package would need it exported.
- [x] DoS honesty: Phase 9's decompression-bomb caps extend across the tree path —
  "peel-exhausted, N layers observed" is still the rendering for anything that hits a
  wall, and CI depth-sweep fixtures assert the wall-clock cap holds across chain shapes
  while benchstat tracks the aggregate-CPU delta so the same-budget guarantee is
  measured, never assumed.
  Shipped: every decode is bounded by the remaining output budget (the bomb cap extends
  across the whole tree), exhaustion renders as `peel-exhausted` with a reason, and the
  depth-sweep + bomb-cap + fuzz tests assert the caps hold. Open: the benchstat
  aggregate-CPU tracking in CI.
  **Shipped 2026-11-06:** the caps extend to the zip layer (declared-size bomb profile
  refuses an archive before a member is opened; every decompressed byte is charged to
  the shared wall; 32,768-member cap; wall clock checked every 256 members), with
  tests across nine chain shapes and an aggregate-CPU test against process rusage, and
  `cpu-ns/op` benchmarks (`BenchmarkPeelDepth`, `BenchmarkPeelArchive`). **Open:** the
  benchstat wiring in CI.
- [ ] ATT&CK framing: T1027 family (partial) with the chain-pattern classification
  itself drafted as an ATT&CK submission alongside the other NOVEL families.
- [ ] Publication rule: detectors, synthetic fixtures and templates are public; the
  offensive framing (bypass notes, source implementation, live payloads) does not enter
  this repo. If a technique description cannot be written without becoming a recipe, it
  ships as a short alert-name reference only.

## Phase 11 — Linux ATT&CK coverage matrix (detection requirements)

The ArcticFox corpus also carries a full ATT&CK Enterprise/Linux mapping. What transfers
into this plan is the technique ID list — expressed as the engine's Linux coverage
requirements, written from detection definitions rather than from the source material's
implementation and evasion columns, which remain internal under the Phase 10 rule. The
source's duplicate T1546.016 rows are deduplicated; T1055/T1620 share one analytic;
T1091 (unimplemented in the corpus) is dropped.

- [x] `cau coverage --format sarif`: per-technique state rendered as detected / partial /
  planned / none. Same honesty rule as the Phase 4 matrix: techniques with no rule are
  reported, never padded. Shipped 2026-10-29: the expectation file gained `partial` and
  `none` states beside `covered` and `gap`, `cau coverage --format sarif` writes a
  SARIF 2.1.0 log (one rule/result per technique, planned gaps as warnings, help URIs
  into attack.mitre.org), and `make coverage` emits `eval-out/attack-coverage.sarif`.
- [ ] Provenance is the benign anchor for every inventory row, resolved against the
  Phase 7 #5 provenance DB — alert quality does not depend on per-customer tuning.
- [ ] Fixtures: synthetic blue/red pairs generated at eval time and measured through the
  Phase 1 gates. No source-derived content enters the repo.
- [ ] Coverage honesty: Discovery-via-shell rows ship labeled *partial by design* —
  command-pattern analytics are fallible, and the report says so rather than implying a
  guarantee.
- [ ] The source document (implementation details, per-technique evasion notes, the
  product-by-product bypass summary) remains internal only. This repo ships detections,
  fixtures and coverage states.
- [ ] Analytic-design rule, distilled from the same hardening lessons but kept at
  principle level: no detection may anchor on attacker-controlled surface — process or
  argv names, freely chosen file paths, timing patterns, protocol field values. Detections
  anchor instead on provenance, lineage and presence-floor attributes the adversary
  cannot shed without losing the capability they came for. (NOVEL-004's hash-based
  correlation is the worked example of this rule.)
- [ ] CI measures every detection against the internal bypass corpus on each merge. The
  corpus exists in that context only as test fixtures; its per-technique engineering
  details are never enumerated here. A bypass regression fails the release the same way
  an eval regression does.

## Sensor self-protection — anti-tamper (extends the Phase 11 T1562.001 row)

The sensor assumes it is a target: malware deploys kill-pools (T1562.001) explicitly
against EDR. Countermeasures are integrity and redundancy — never camouflage:

- **Detection-content integrity (engine-side, shipped 2026-11-02):** `cau selftest`
  (`internal/selftest`) digests the signature database, the YARA rules and the fuzzy
  database and compares them against a recorded baseline, so gutting signatures or
  neutering a rule is caught (T1562.001) rather than silently disabling the scanner. A
  plain baseline catches drift; an **Ed25519-signed** baseline verified against a pinned
  key (`--sign-key` / `--pubkey` / `$CAU_SELFTEST_PUBKEY`) also defeats an attacker who
  rewrites both the content and the manifest — the signature is the thing they cannot
  forge. The shipped systemd units run it as an `ExecStartPre` before each scheduled
  scan. The vault and the update channel are durable too: their atomic writers now fsync
  before rename so a crash can't leave a renamed-in file with torn or zero contents.
- **Binary identity:** self-hash at startup, verified against a signed release manifest
  (Phase 7 #1 attestations). Mismatch means fail-closed: halt detection, log, alert —
  never run half-verified. (The signed-manifest machinery `cau selftest` and `cau update`
  already use is the same Ed25519 pattern this needs.)
- **Config integrity:** configs are root-owned, provenance-checked and signed; unsigned
  overrides alert instead of applying. No obfuscation of the config itself — clarity of
  the security state is a feature, and stego-encoded config would trip this program's
  own stego detector (NOVEL-001/002).
- **Process integrity:** the sensor inspects its own `/proc/self/exe`, open-FD inventory
  and periodic self-checks, but identity is anchored by an *independent* supervisor — a
  second dedicated process, or an eBPF-based watchdog keying on the agent's cgroup rather
  than its name. A kill-pool that filters on process names therefore has nothing
  decisive to filter on; the alarms they cannot see keep firing.
- **No masquerading:** the sensor runs under its own product name from a package-owned
  binary. Masquerading as common services (T1036.005 / NOVEL-004 patterns) would collide
  with the provenance inventory rows (T1053.003, T1543.002, T1547.001) and trip
  NOVEL-004's rotation analytic — the agent helps no one by looking like both sides of
  its own detection logic.
- **Console side:** remote attestation per sensor, signed one-way heartbeats, and
  quarantine-on-tamper policy — a tampered sensor drops to containment rather than
  silence.

---

## Kernel-level support & anti-tamper (Linux-first; Windows stays console-side)

Phase 7 #7 chose eBPF over a kernel driver deliberately. "Kernel level" here completes
that story — plus the honest assumption underneath all of it: a compromised kernel cannot
be inspected from inside itself, so every anti-tamper design leans on anchors *outside*
it (TPM, provenance, a second process, the VM layer, or the crash itself).

**First increment shipped 2026-11-02 in a separate repo, `cau-kernel`** (kept out of the
stdlib engine because it is kernel-adjacent): a userspace Go **detection** sensor plus an
eBPF **enforcement** program.
- Detection (`cau-kernel inventory|posture|baseline|drift`): reads kernel state from
  `/proc` and `/sys` — loaded modules with a `/sys/module` cross-view
  (**hidden-module reconciliation**), decoded taint (unsigned/out-of-tree/force-load/
  livepatch/OOPS bits), the eBPF surface (bpffs mounts, pinned objects, JIT-harden /
  `unprivileged_bpf_disabled`), kernel-memory channels (`/dev/mem,kmem,port`,
  `/proc/kcore`, lockdown), and hardening posture (the sysctl set, lockdown, LSM list,
  IMA). It reports **drift against an Ed25519-signed baseline** (fail-closed on a bad
  signature), degrading unreadable nodes to warnings. This delivers the "kernel hook/
  state inventory", "state-drift", "hardening posture report class", "kernel-memory
  access channels", "BPF surface inventory" and "cross-view/hidden-module" rows below, in
  userspace.
- Enforcement (`bpf/lsm_guard.bpf.c` + `cau-kernel enforce`): a real **BPF-LSM** program
  on `lsm/bprm_check_security` — an execution-freeze latch for tamper response — compiled
  to a verified eBPF object, **with a cilium/ebpf loader** (`enforce run` attaches and
  pins the control map to bpffs; `enforce on|off|status` flip it; fail-open if the
  resident process dies). Behind an `ebpf` build tag so the default sensor stays
  dependency-free. Loading needs root + `CONFIG_BPF_LSM` + `bpf` in
  `/sys/kernel/security/lsm`. GitHub CI builds both the default and the eBPF-tagged binary
  on every push.
- Boot attestation (`cau-kernel attest`): records/verifies TPM PCRs, the IMA
  measurement-log summary, and kdump readiness against an Ed25519-signed baseline — a
  changed PCR flags a different boot chain. Reads real PCRs; IMA degrades honestly off
  root.
- Second enforcement backend (`kmod/cau_guard.c`): a **loadable kernel module**
  (kretprobe on `security_bprm_check`) — the "where BPF-LSM cannot serve" option the plan
  reserves. More capable than eBPF (arbitrary in-kernel C, no verifier, any hook), with
  the honest trade-off (out-of-tree, taints the kernel, needs Secure-Boot signing);
  BPF-LSM stays the safer default. DKMS-packaged.
- Path-aware CO-RE BPF-LSM (`bpf/lsm_fileopen.bpf.c`): per-inode deny via `lsm/file_open`
  + a `cau_blocked_inodes` map, inode read through `BPF_CORE_READ`.
- The repo is published (`s-b-repo/cau-kernel`) with full docs (`docs/`), and **GitHub CI
  builds everything green on every push** — four jobs: Go build/vet/race-test, the BPF-LSM
  object + cilium/ebpf loader, the CO-RE object (bpftool-generated `vmlinux.h`), and the
  kernel module (`linux-headers`). Parsers and the signed-baseline verifier are fuzzed.
- CO-RE loader wiring (`enforce run --core` + `enforce block|unblock|blocked`): the
  path-aware object is loaded from a file at runtime and its per-inode blocklist map is
  driven from the CLI (resolve a path to its inode, deny opening it) — so a responder can
  quarantine a specific dropped file while the host keeps running.
- **Still open there** (needs real hardware/VMM/root the build cannot exercise, not code
  that is merely unwritten): **vkernel** guest introspection (KVM/QEMU + libvmi), **kdump
  capture** (a privileged destructive crash trigger left to policy), TPM **quote-based**
  remote attestation (PCR *reads* and signed-baseline drift ship; a signed `TPM2_Quote`
  needs TPM access this build environment lacks), and continuous real-time hooks /
  live-mediation testing (needs root on a BPF-LSM kernel). Shipping these untested would
  break measure-or-don't-ship; they are documented in `cau-kernel/docs/`.

**Sensor kernel components (Linux):**
- [ ] BPF-LSM first: the sensor registers as an LSM (signed, package-managed) for real
  blocking decisions — exec, mount, socket connect, ptrace, module load — beyond passive
  telemetry. This is the kernel-native enforcement point without the out-of-tree-driver
  brittleness.
- [ ] Minimal signed out-of-tree module only where BPF-LSM cannot serve, DKMS-packaged
  with a kernel-version matrix in CI; never loads unsigned. Windows kernel components
  land in the closed console sensor per the licensing-leak rule — the OSS engine ships
  nothing it cannot verify.
- [ ] "vkernel" mode for VM fleets, opt-in: KVM/QEMU guest introspection driven from the
  host via QMP — console queries process/memory/network state of a guest from a layer the
  guest's rootkit cannot see or unhook. Off by default; guest-free on the guest itself.

**Anti kernel / firmware tampering:**
- [ ] Boot-anchored measurement: verified measured-boot state (TPM PCRs) plus IMA
  appraisal before the sensor starts; an unexpected PCR state puts the sensor into
  containment mode (self-protection section above) instead of scanning from a client the
  kernel could lie to.
- [ ] Kernel hook inventory at rest and on change: kprobe/ftrace/livepatch/eBPF program
  tables and LSM registrations diffed against a signed baseline — NOVEL-010's analytic
  generalized to every attach point; anything not fleet-pinned alerts.
- [ ] Kernel state drift checks: module list, taints and signature state against the
  provenance DB; kernel symbol-table diff (kallsyms with KASLR-aware rebasing) against
  the package-owned baseline. Firmware side remains Phase 8's surface — runtime
  efivarfs/DBX/option-ROM diffs are re-checked on every boot, making its layers one
  contiguous tamper story from boot chain to runtime.
- [ ] Crash-capture containment: on tamper suspicion the host forces a kdump snapshot
  before anything can react — a capture a running rootkit cannot scrub ex post — and the
  image goes to console-side memory forensics (Volatility3-class parsing feeding the
  Phase 5 ML ladder offline). Live findings are tripwires; the dump is the verdict.
- [ ] In-kernel heuristics (rkhunter-class) exist only as tripwires routed through the
  higher-privilege verifier. Nothing inside a compromised kernel is trusted to declare
  itself clean.

**Kernel-gap sweep (added audits):**
- [ ] Hardening posture as a report class: kernel sysctl/integrity state —
  `kptr_restrict`, `dmesg_restrict`, `yama.ptrace_scope`, `unprivileged_bpf_disabled`,
  `perf_event_paranoid`, `modules_disabled`, `module.sig_enforce`, `kexec_load_disabled`,
  `bpf_jit_harden`, lockdown mode — rendered per host with drift alerts on change events
  (sysctl write watch). Posture is reported honestly; blocking still belongs to
  BPF-LSM, not to scolding the operator's config.
- [ ] Kernel-memory access channels: audit opens of `/dev/mem`, `/dev/kmem` and
  `/proc/kcore`; unexpected access alerts and escalates straight to crash capture
  (these are the classic direct paths to kernel tampering).
- [ ] Cross-view process reconciliation: `/proc/loadavg`'s scheduler thread counter vs.
  the enumerated task list. A mismatch is a hidden-process tripwire that escalates to
  the kdump verifier — neither view is trusted alone, and the dump is the tiebreak.
- [ ] Hidden-module reconciliation in the dump: module-object walk inside the crash
  image vs. `/sys/module` enumeration — memory truth over runtime truth, closing the
  hidden-LKM seam that the runtime drift check cannot see.
- [ ] `io_uring` coverage fixture: CI asserts BPF-LSM file-operation hooks observe
  ops issued through `io_uring` (a known audit/monitoring seam). If the seam exists,
  it closes at the LSM layer — never by pretending the API is not used.
- [ ] BPF surface inventory: bpffs mounts, pinned maps and programs, JIT hardening
  state — extends NOVEL-010's attach-point coverage to the filesystem side of BPF.

## Sensor self-verification — hardware-anchored identity

Self-protection proves the sensor survives tampering. This adds the second proof: that
what is running *is what the console thinks it is*, anchored in hardware roots rather
than in host-controlled state. Extends the kernel section's measured-boot work and the
Phase 7 #1 attestation pipeline from boot-time to the runtime lifecycle.

| Anchor | Verification | Attack class defeated |
|---|---|---|
| TPM quote lifecycle | sensor runtime state is quoted at every check-in; console verifies against the EK certificate and the PCR chain, stale/replayed quotes are rejected by freshness window | agent spoofing, stolen-identity replay |
| DMI/SMBIOS identity | UUID, board serial, product and chassis serial recorded at first enrollment; console flags duplicate serials across the fleet | cloned-host identity theft — two sensors claiming one physical machine |
| NIC permanent MAC | interface-configured MAC vs the NIC's EEPROM/burned-in address (`ethtool -P` / netlink), divergence is L2 self-misdescription | MAC spoofing and L2 anonymization attempts — the packet guard's egress-spoof row gains a hardware witness |
| Hardware monotonic counters | monotonic receipts chained into every event stream; console rejects out-of-order sequences under an EK-certified identity | event-stream replay with stolen keys |
| Entropy-source health | hardware RNG failures degrade the sensor to software entropy as a labeled alert-posted state, never a silent fallback | quiet weak-entropy degradation of the sensor's own crypto |

- [~] `internal/hwanchor`: quote capture, DMI snapshot, permanent-MAC divergence check;
  attestation receipts land in the console's fleet/identity surfaces, feeding the
  identity-continuity row's machine-id collision work.
  **Engine half shipped 2026-11-06** as `internal/hwanchor` + `cau hwid`: a read-only
  sysfs snapshot (DMI/SMBIOS, NIC address and `addr_assign_type`, TPM presence and
  PCRs 0-7, the active hardware RNG), `--record` / `--check` against a baseline with
  typed differences, and `--redact` for a shareable snapshot. The package never writes
  (enforced by a source test). **Open:** no TPM quote is captured (it needs `/dev/tpm0`
  and an attestation key; the PCRs here are the kernel's unsigned report); the
  burned-in MAC is not read (it needs an ethtool ioctl), so the check shows that an
  address was changed, not from what; the baseline is not signed; receipts to a
  console are console work.
- [x] Honest degradation as a first-class state: no TPM, no EEPROM permanent address,
  and hardware crypto offload planes render *unverifiable* — labeled degraded in every
  report and coverage rendering, never silently padded to "verified". The free-reporting
  honesty rule runs on hardware data too.
  **Shipped 2026-11-06** in `cau hwid`: every field carries a state (`ok`, `absent`,
  `unreadable`, `placeholder`), the `unverifiable` list names every anchor the host
  could not prove and is never empty, a comparison only uses fields that are `ok` on
  both sides, and "could not be re-verified" is a different result from "changed".
  Crypto-offload planes are not inventoried, so they are not covered by this row yet.
- [ ] Fleet pivots: duplicate serials and MAC divergences join the Threat Graph — "two
  hosts claim the same hardware identity" is an automatic incident class.
- [ ] Privacy: DMI/SMBIOS serials are hardware metadata retained under the same
  host-scope posture as device-plane inventory — class and identity only, no content
  leaves the host.

## Exploit-attempt ledger — kernel, hardware, network planes

The plan's existing rows detect behavior and persistence. This adds the third tier: the
*attempt itself* — exploitation events caught as events, before (or without) any
compromise landing — formalized across planes into one ledger instead of scattered
signals. Some taps exist already (kcore alerts, taint drift, kallsyms diffs, kprobe
hook inventory); the ledger is what makes them the same thing.

| Plane | Attempt events the ledger receives |
|---|---|
| Kernel | oops/BUG event clusters, taint-state changes, `/proc/kcore` + `/proc/kallsyms` access from unexpected lineages, kprobe/ftrace registration by non-package lineage (extends the anti-tamper section's per-check inventories into the attempt surface) |
| Privilege | ptrace / `process_vm_readv/writev` against privileged targets, setuid-exec chains from unexpected parents, capset events — the privesc ladder, observed rung by rung |
| Hardware | flash/MTD/ESP firmware-write events from non-updater lineage (the companion to the Phase 8 scanner: attempts caught as events, implants caught as images), PCIe enumeration diffs, IOMMU/DMA-fault events formalized out of the device-plane rows |
| Network | protocol-anomaly probe storms at service ports (T1595.002), malformed-flag sweeps (packet-addendum tie), and the probe→fault→lineage chain that upgrades a probe to a confirmed attempt; the netguard MITM rows supply the L2 half |
| Memory | memfd/deleted-inode exec (T1106) and the runtime unpack taps (NOVEL-012) join as compromise-evidence classes |

- [ ] `internal/exploitledger`: one attempt-ledger keyed by lineage and evidence class,
  unifying the taps above; every entry carries a *status* — attempt observed vs
  compromise confirmed — resolved from chain state, never merged.
- [ ] Attempt→compromise upgrade is the ledger's whole point: fault-then-lineage,
  unpack taps and crash capture can promote an entry, and the promotion event itself
  lands as a timeline pivot ("attempt → confirmed" is one graph hop).
- [ ] Coverage honesty: attempts and compromises count separately in every coverage
  rendering, forever — an attempt is never padded into a compromise and vice versa.
- [ ] Hardware-plane boundary, stated: implants below PCI-enumeration visibility do not
  run on this host — Phase 8's scanner is the sole truth source; the ledger carries
  interception *attempts* and documents the floor, not iommu-backed completeness.
- [ ] Ring-0 boundary, stated: a fully compromised kernel defeats runtime checks by
  definition — the ledger carries attempt evidence; prevention claims live in the
  anti-tamper section and nowhere else.
- [ ] Fleet pivot: "three hosts observed the same probe/flash/DMA shape within an hour"
  is an automatic fleet-incident class, the netguard corroboration pattern applied to
  the attempt plane.
- [ ] Perf honesty: attempt-class taps vary wildly in volume — kcore reads are rare,
  probe storms are not — so per-class throughput budgets and drop-policy under load
  apply, benched in CI.
- [ ] Fixtures: synthetic oopses, flash-write events and protocol probes generated at
  eval time, blue/red pairs only — attempt-class FP/FN numbers through the Phase 1
  gates.

## Defense-in-depth hardening — the product is also a target

Every layer of this architecture is itself attackable surface. The stance from the scope
note applies upward: assume the components are discoverable, and make discovery
pointless by making attacks fail — never by hiding.

**Engine (CLI/library)**
- [x] Read-only by construction: scanning never executes or writes sample content; the
  MCP path is the only sandboxed exception (Phase 3).
  **Enforced 2026-11-06** by `TestScanningNeverExecutesOrWritesSamples` and
  `TestProcessExecutionIsAllowlisted` (`source_gates_test.go`): nothing under `scanner/`
  or `internal/peeler/` may import `os/exec`, `net`, `net/http` or `plugin`, start a
  process, or open a file for writing outside two allowlisted functions that append to
  an operator-named signature database; and every importer of `os/exec` in the engine
  is listed with what it runs (today: the `cau-kernel` helper from `cau ps`, and
  nft/iptables from the network blocker). Quarantine moves a file on an explicit
  `--quarantine`; that is response, outside the scanning packages, and not covered here.
- [x] Renderer injection closed: file paths, threat names and rule metas are data to
  every report renderer (text/JSON/SARIF) — structured and escaped, never concatenated
  into templates; a fixture with hostile filenames runs in CI.
  **Closed 2026-11-06** by `TestEveryFormatTreatsAHostileFileNameAsData`
  (`internal/report/hostile_formats_test.go`): one file name carrying every line
  format's separators, a newline plus a forged syslog frame, a terminal escape and a
  bidi override is rendered in all fourteen `--format` values; none gains a result or a
  line, none emits a raw escape byte, and the JSON formats return it byte for byte. The
  fixture exercises the file path; threat names and rule metas take the same code
  paths but are not separately fuzzed with hostile values.
- [ ] Resource exhaustion pinned: per-run budgets (jobs, memory, time, decompression
  caps) verified against the adversarial fixture corpus from the Phase 9 fuzzing work.

**Sensor (host)**
- [ ] Privilege separation: a minimal privileged collector (eBPF/LSM) and an
  unprivileged analysis process joined by a credentials-checked unix socket
  (SO_PEERCRED) — a compromised analysis side cannot touch kernel telemetry or load
  rules into the collector.
- [ ] SELinux/AppArmor policy modules ship in the package; no listening network ports on
  the host (console-relay model with mTLS and per-identity keys).
- [ ] Runtime artifacts hard-permissioned (root-owned, 0640) — nothing world-readable
  that doubles as recon material for T1562 kill-pool attacks, which are themselves a
  detection row (Phase 11).

**Console (server)**
- [ ] Rootless containers, distroless runtime images (no shell inside), `cap_drop: ALL`,
  secrets only in the platform keychain/KMS, TLS everywhere.
- [ ] Auth hardening as a checked posture: no default credentials (first admin is a
  one-time bootstrap token), lockout policy on auth failures (the console's own T1110
  row), CSP/CSRF/cookie flags and endpoint rate limits verified in CI, step-up approval
  for irreversible actions (pairs with the exclusions governance).
- [ ] Audit log is append-only at the storage layer, so a compromised console process
  cannot rewrite history.

**Distribution (signed update channel)**
- [ ] Anti-rollback protection: a persisted, monotonic minimum-version floor — a validly
  signed *old* bundle must be refused. The classic gap in otherwise-correct signed
  update schemes, now closed in `cau update` and the air-gap bundles alike.
- [ ] Reproducible builds + SBOM + SLSA attestations (Phase 7 #1, Phase 9) close the
  supply chain end-to-end; the Phase 4 release channel inherits all three.

**MCP / analysis agents**
- [ ] Path allowlists, size caps and timeouts (Phase 3 non-negotiables), plus evidence
  minimization: raw sample content stays in the sandbox — agents receive verdicts and
  bounded excerpts, never verbatim payloads (the injection-defense surface owned by
  Phase 7 console governance).

**On "stop them from looking for this":** enumeration of the agent is assumed. What it
buys an attacker is bounded by construction — kill-pools matching agent names trip the
NOVEL-005 row, name-independent supervisors keep firing (self-protection section),
tamper fails closed, and a kill attempt escalates to crash capture. Camouflage and
anti-detection styling of our own components remain refused under the scope note:
discovery resistance here means attack failure, not invisibility.

## Garlic-routed telemetry — agents forward what relays can't read

Transport architecture, borrowed from I2P's garlic routing: telemetry travels in
multi-hop bundles ("cloves") where every forwarding hop peels only its own routing
layer and forwards what it cannot read. Only the sink's key opens the contents — and
there are two sinks, each with its own key.

| Path element | What it does |
|---|---|
| Clove bundling | the agent batches event cloves into shipments; padding to size classes and timing jitter/mix budgets shrink traffic correlation |
| Per-sink end-to-end encryption | the dashboard and the customer's Wazuh sink each receive an independently E2E-encrypted copy — CAU never holds the Wazuh sink's key, so CAU cannot read the customer's SIEM events |
| Hop-layer separation | relays (CAU-operated, customer-owned fleet relays, or community relays) learn only that traffic passed and who their neighbors are; host identity rides the E2E layer only, never the hop layer |
| Fleet relay mode | self-hosted relay mesh stays inside the customer network — the air-gapped deployment gets garlic routing with zero CAU transit |
| Direct fallback | relay-mesh outage falls back to direct QUIC with a `transport: direct-fallback` label rendered in coverage — delivery never silently changes character |

- [ ] `internal/garlic`: clove bundler (batching, size-class padding, jitter/mix
  budgeting), hop-layer crypto, and per-sink receipts; no relay anywhere holds a
  content key.
- [ ] Cryptography: hybrid X25519+ML-KEM-768 key agreement on QUIC/TLS 1.3, ML-DSA
  signatures for relay receipts — extending the Phase 9 post-quantum chain from
  update bundles to the telemetry path. Terminology honesty: the plan says
  *post-quantum cryptography* against quantum adversaries' future compute, never
  "quantum encryption/QKD" — QKD needs specialized hardware shipments and is not what
  ships; no overclaim enters any surface.
- [ ] QUIC mechanics: per-class streams (priority events and bulk telemetry share one
  connection cleanly), 0-RTT resume for ephemeral/CI sensors that reconnect constantly,
  connection migration for mobile or DHCP-shuffled fleets.
- [ ] Latency honesty: garlic routing buys metadata privacy with latency — so critical-
  class events may default to a short path (one hop or direct) as an explicit per-class
  fleet-profile choice, and the default is stated, never silent. Bulk telemetry takes
  the full path.
- [ ] The traffic-analysis claim is enumerated precisely: relays gain content
  confidentiality and neighborhood-only metadata — strictly better than the industry-
  default direct upload, and *not* a claim of perfect anonymity set. Where correlation
  remains possible, the doc says so.
- [ ] Replay protection: monotonic-counter receipts from the hardware-anchor row chain
  into sink ingestion — a replayed batch cannot re-enter either sink.
- [ ] Relay fairness: token buckets per source-relay mirror the peeler fairness rules
  — a flooded relay can't starve the fleet's transport, and DoS budgets benched in CI.
- [ ] Self-hosted console note: customers who want *no* CAU-readable copies at all
  point both sinks at self-hosted infrastructure; the dashboard path exists for those
  who don't. Both paths are rendered in pricing and the licensing rows, not hidden.
- [ ] `cau selftest` gains a transport row: mesh-hop aliveness, hop-crypto handshake
  state, and fallback state surface in fleet health.

## Transport ladder for server fleets — when direct and mesh fail

The garlic section's direct fallback assumes egress exists. Server fleets often do
not: strict-firewall egress, QUIC-blocking middleboxes, mandatory proxies, and
occasional total loss of outbound. The ladder below is the order the sensor tries,
per fleet profile, with every rung transition rendered as its own timeline event.

| Rung | Path | When it applies |
|---|---|---|
| 0 | Fleet egress diversity: a neighbor server with an alternate route carries the stuck host's alert-class events over the local link | direct fails, a fleet sibling has egress |
| 1 | Direct QUIC on 443 | normal operation |
| 2 | TCP-443 with HTTP/2 framing | middleboxes block UDP/QUIC |
| 3 | Customer proxy — `HTTPS_PROXY`/CONNECT, PAC-aware; MASQUE-style HTTP/3-in-TCP tunneling | strict firewalled egress |
| 3.5 | Echo-lane — QUIC-like alert transport over ICMP echo, post-quantum E2E | UDP, TCP and proxies all filtered; ICMP survives |
| 4 | Emergency band — BMC/Redfish or a pre-provisioned bastion pull, alert-class events only | all host egress fails |
| 5 | Local spool with retention caps, host rendered `transport: unreachable` | everything fails |

- [ ] Spool is encrypted at rest under the vault row and replay-safe: monotonic
  receipts from the hardware-anchor row dedupe redelivery on reconnect, so a full
  spool drains once, not twice.
- [ ] When the spool fills, the event-loss policy decides what sheds — by labeled
  class, never silently, and the rendering says which classes dropped and why.
- [ ] Emergency band is opt-in and BMC-honest: it depends on controller presence and
  admin consent, carries alert-class only, and is documented as a quarantine-grade
  band rather than telemetry — the BMC stays what the cross-system sweep says it is.
- [ ] Fleet egress diversity is opt-in and L2-local: the carrying host forwards under
  the garlic receipt scheme, and carries under the same token-bucket fairness so a
  carried host cannot flood its carrier.
- [ ] Air-gapped servers use rung 5 + the media shuttle: spool ships by signed,
  manifest-verified removable media — the update channel's post-quantum chain covers
  the telemetry shuttle both directions.
- [ ] The ladder is per-fleet-profile configuration with stated defaults; every rung
  transition lands on the timeline (`transport: rung-3-proxy` etc.), and `cau
  selftest` renders current rung, spool depth, and last-success rung in fleet health.
- [ ] A host is never dark: `transport: unreachable` is a *state* in the console, not
  an absence — consistent with the no-silent-kill rule.

---

---

## Echo-lane — post-quantum ICMP transport for alert-class events

 QUIC's semantics rebuilt over ICMP echo request/reply: connection identity in the
echo identifier, offsets in the sequence space, payload bytes in the echo data — the
last usable wire in networks where UDP, TCP and proxy egress are all filtered but
ICMP echo passes. Named honestly: this is PQC over a hostile path, not "quantum
encryption" per the standing terminology rule.

- [ ] `internal/echolane`: connection-id → echo identifier, stream offsets → sequence
  space, payload chunking across consecutive echo frames at path MTU (~1472 bytes per
  echo at 1500). Reliability via reply-acked windows with idempotent, nonce-keyed
  retries. Stream multiplexing rides the garlic clove model so the lane and the mesh
  share one framing.
- [ ] Crypto parity: the same per-sink hybrid X25519+ML-KEM-768 end-to-end agreement
  and ML-DSA receipts as every other lane — no downgrade because the path is hostile,
  and monotonic-counter receipts keep replayed frames out of the sinks.
- [ ] Class honesty: alert-class only, never bulk telemetry. ICMP is kernel rate-limited
  (`icmp_ratelimit`), middlebox-deprioritized, and MTU-capped — the lane paces under
  the default limits and does not pretend to be a full transport. Bulk stays on the
  spool; the ladder's rung 5 remains the honest fallback.
- [ ] Detector self-consistency: the plan's own T1095 ICMP analytics flag unpinned
  echo payload-cadence *by design* — the echo lane is provenance-pinned (fleet-pinned
  sink identifiers, sensor-signed receipts on both directions) and emits a
  `fleet-owned echo lane` event class, so our own detector and our own lane coexist
  honestly. `cau selftest` asserts the pinning instead of assuming it.
- [ ] Spoofing honesty: ICMP is trivially spoofable — nothing in-band is trusted
  before ML-DSA receipt verification, and "on-path or ring-0 attackers can inject
  noise" is stated in the lane's own documentation. The channel's answer is
  authentication and receipts, not the IP layer's goodwill.
- [ ] Injection-tolerance: frame-level nonce idempotence means duplicate or
  attacker-injected frames are detected and dropped at receipt verification; budget
  for the DoS class is the same fairness model as the relay and peel paths.
- [ ] Timeline ties: `transport: rung-3.5-echo-lane` transitions are timeline events
  like every other rung, and the layer renders in fleet health.

## Packet-layer guard — L2/L3 spoofing from the host's eye

Phase 11 covers host behavior; this covers the bearer layer. Host-based honesty up front:
a single host cannot fully verify a switching fabric, so the guard owns the narrow,
truthful slice it *can* see — kernel-asserted events and packet taps — labeled by
evidence class, alert-only by default, with inline drop only as an opt-in per-host
profile.

| Signal | Detection analytic | Mapping |
|---|---|---|
| ARP conflict / IP→MAC churn | netlink duplicate-address events (kernel-asserted) + gratuitous-ARP rate + ARP table churn entropy | T1557.002 |
| Rogue DHCP | multiple OFFER sources within a lease window vs. lease history | T1557.003 |
| DHCP starvation | NAK/DECLINE storms and lease-exhaustion cadence around the host | — |
| LLMNR / NBT-NS / mDNS poisoning | the host answers only names it owns; an answer from *another* host for one of ours is the tripwire | T1557.001 |
| IPv6 RA spoofing / router churn | conflicting RAs, multiple router claims, DAD conflicts | T1557 family (no dedicated ATT&CK sub-technique — noted honestly) |
| Martian / spoofed-local ingress | rp_filter drop counters + TTL-floor check (a packet claiming a same-subnet source with a remote-hop TTL is lying) | anti-spoof, ingress |
| Egress spoof check | outbound frames sourced from an IP not configured on the interface, or prefix/MAC mismatch — a compromised stack, a relay, or an injected frame | anti-spoof, egress |
| ICMP redirect ingress | kernel event tap — a classic MITM primitive that should not exist on a configured host | MITM primitive |
| BPDU / LLDP / CDP surprises | a host never speaks STP; unexpected LLDP/CDP from a non-switch MAC means rogue infrastructure on the wire | — |
| VLAN double-tag (QinQ) arrival | extra 802.1Q tags on an access-port frame — VLAN-hopping recon | — |
| Resolver answer anomalies | NXDOMAIN-then-success oscillation and TTL-zero corporate names — cache-poisoning fingerprints seen from the local resolver | MITM (DNS) |

- [ ] `internal/netguard`: eBPF tc/XDP taps plus netlink/proc event taps, feeding the one
  internal event model (all sink formats behave per the Phase 7 #9 matrix), with the
  "kernel-asserted vs inferred" evidence labeling required by the free-reporting rules.
- [ ] Both directions: every analytic runs ingress (spoofed arrival) and egress
  (compromised stack or injected frame going out).
- [ ] Fleet corroboration through the Threat Graph (#Phase 7 #8): one host observing a
  MAC claiming the gateway is suspicion; three hosts observing the same MAC within an
  hour is a fleet incident — cross-host IP→MAC churn history upgrades single-host alerts
  automatically.
- [ ] ATT&CK rows land in the Phase 11 `frameworks` object and the coverage matrix; the
  two honest gap-marked rows (RA spoofing, DHCP starvation) stay gap-marked until their
  ATT&CK submission lands upstream — coverage is never padded.

---

## Packet-guard addendum — the IP-plane gaps

The guard's table covered L2 spoof-arrival and the host's own anti-spoof tripwires.
This extends the plane with the IP/transport checks a host can legitimately run, plus
the kernel counters it already exposes — same taps, same event model, no second sensor.

| Signal | Detection analytic | Mapping |
|---|---|---|
| IP fragmentation plane | oversized/short fragments, overlapping fragments, mid-flow DF-bit flips, fragment-flood cadence vs baseline | — (gap-marked, submission candidate) |
| TCP-flag plane | malformed-flag sweeps, RST-injection probing of long-lived sessions, cross-checked against conntrack/session state | — (gap-marked) |
| Neighbor-table churn | `ip neigh` state oscillation and probe storms — L2 enumeration fingerprints reflected in the host's own table | T1046 family (partial) |
| Raw-socket ownership | AF_PACKET socket inventory vs provenance — who runs packet captures on this host besides the sensor itself | — (counter-surveillance) |
| Interface creation | tun/tap/gre/sit/wireguard interface creation by non-package lineage — tunnel construction is a channel primitive before it is a traffic pattern | T1572 |
| Routing-plane tamper | route-table and rpdb rule diffs, XFRM/IPsec/WireGuard state changes vs provenance — a host whose routing is re-described goes quietly blind | — (gap-marked, submission candidate) |
| Conntrack exhaustion | ct-table pressure cadence — conntrack starvation is a drop-everything interference class against the host's own visibility | T1498 family (partial) |
| MACsec / crypto offload | macsec interface inventory; the guard sees only post-decryption frames — the boundary is documented, not pretended away | — (honest boundary) |

- [ ] `internal/netguard` extension: these rows ride the same tc/XDP and netlink tap
  set; kernel drop counters flow through the same "kernel-asserted vs inferred"
  evidence labeling.
- [ ] The gap-marked rows stay gap-marked until ATT&CK submissions land upstream —
  coverage is never padded, per the guard's own rule.
- [ ] Fragment-plane honesty: if fragment reassembly is attempted at the tap, it is a
  *new parser* and goes through the Phase 9 fuzzing gate like every other parser —
  reassembly bugs are a scanner liability, not a free win.
- [ ] Interface-creation telemetry ties to the cloud/egress sweep: a wireguard
  interface appearing on a node that runs no VPN workload correlates with the
  destination-endpoint inventory first, alerts second.

## Cleartext-plane detection — plaintext on the wire

Cleartext protocols are half a detection plane, half a posture surface: plaintext on
the wire leaks credentials, session tokens and payload shapes to every on-path
observer, and the *attempt to strip encryption* is a MITM primitive in its own right.
All rows are passive tap analytics; content-shape heuristics are opt-in, never
default-on.

| Signal | Detection analytic | Mapping |
|---|---|---|
| Plaintext protocol inventory | service-balance fingerprinting at flow start (HTTP/1.0, FTP, telnet, SNMPv1/2c, syslog-over-UDP, LDAP:389, POP3/IMAP without TLS, VNC without TLS, SMTP without STARTTLS) — first-seen per host, classified | posture/exposure (—) |
| Credential-shaped plaintext | token-shaped heuristics on cleartext fields (`AUTH`, form-encoded credential looks, RFC-2617-style headers) — heuristic by construction, labeled as such | DLP-lite (T1552-adjacent, opt-in) |
| STARTTLS/TLS strip attempts | per-peer TLS-capability memory — "spoke TLS yesterday, plaintext now to the same endpoint" is the stripping tripwire; corroborated cross-host like every netguard MITM row | T1557 family |
| SNM-community exposure | default/community-string patterns in v1/v2c flows | T1552-adjacent (—) |
| Listener exposure | passive listener inventory (`ss`-class passive pass): what *cleartext services this host offers* — the fleet exposure report ranks hosts by wire-plaintext surface | posture (—) |
| Weak-TLS posture | TLS-hello analytics: versions < 1.2, export/legacy ciphers, no PFS, expired/odd chains — plaintext's quiet cousin | posture (—) |

- [ ] `internal/clearplane`: flow-start classifiers + passive listener pass, joined by
  per-peer TLS-capability state; no content store — cleartext *classes*, lengths and
  fingerprints only, per the free-reporting privacy rules.
- [ ] Credential-shape analytics are DLP-lite: opt-in per fleet profile, token-shape
  heuristics honestly labeled heuristic (not a credential vault), fixtures only in
  Phase 1 gates, no content capture by default.
- [ ] Downgrade tripwire pairs with the netguard MITM rows and the trust-store row —
  a stripping attempt rarely arrives alone; fleet corroboration upgrades single-host
  signals structurally.
- [ ] The weak-TLS posture row merges with the listener exposure row into one fleet
  exposure report class: cleartext listeners, weak TLS versions, token-carrying
  cleartext flows — posture-as-product, classes not payloads.
- [ ] Honest boundary: the sensor sees flows terminating at or originating on its own
  host; routed-through transit flows stay invisible — the same boundary the packet
  guard documents, restated so nobody assumes DPI completeness.
- [ ] Coverage honesty: protocol classifiers are first-byte heuristics — a protocol
  that doesn't declare itself renders as *partial*, and the exposure report says so
  instead of implying a complete inventory.

## Cross-system gap sweep — planes the plan still missed

Kernel, firmware, packet and host-state are covered; these are the remaining systems
where an attacker operates underneath normal EDR visibility. Same rules as everywhere:
provenance is the benign anchor, evidence class is labeled, and every row lands in the
coverage matrix via the Phase 11 `frameworks` object.

| Plane | Gap in the current plan | Deliverable |
|---|---|---|
| Identity (sudo/SSSD/FreeIPA/SSH keys) | PAM/cron/systemd inventories exist; identity *config* drift is unmonitored | `internal/identity`: sudoers.d churn, new group-sudo members, sssd/IdP config diffs, authorized_keys and ssh_config (ProxyCommand) drift per host — extends the fleet key-reuse row (T1021.004) with per-host state |
| Trust store | MITM enabler nobody watches: root-CA additions/removals, per-app NSS trust churn, world-readable key material | drift watch on system + NSS trust stores; pairs with Phase 2 signer-implausibility work and the netguard MITM rows (T1557) |
| Log continuity | T1070.002 clears logs; journald has no native tamper-evidence | shipper writes a hash-chained continuity header per rotation; "gap" and "rewind" alerts at console; volume-vacuum events alert |
| Time continuity | clock manipulation defeats cross-host correlation silently | clock-step and chrony/NTP tamper events as sensor telemetry; console-side cross-host monotonicity check — a host whose timeline steps backwards against fleet consensus is flagged, correlation queues freeze rather than mis-order |
| Devices (USB/HID) | removable media and input capture invisible today | new-device inventory (vendor/product first-seen), HID grabber detection (EVIOCGRAB and `/dev/input` readers outside an interactive session — T1056.001), and an engine hook to auto-scan mounted removable media |
| Container escape seams | scan-time coverage exists (Phase 9); runtime escape indicators do not | socket-permission audits (docker/containerd sockets), privileged-container telemetry, cgroup `release_agent` writes and `nsenter` host-pivot alerts (T1611 family) at the sensor |
| BMC / out-of-band (Redfish) | Phase 8 covers host firmware; BMCs are the unowned floor beneath it | console-side Redfish periodic audit: BMC firmware inventory, default-credential fingerprint, BMC-LAN segmentation state — gap-marked in ATT&CK until a mapping exists upstream |
| CI runner profile | build hosts self-scan today by hand | a sensor *mode* for ephemeral CI hosts: short-lived identity, secrets-usage telemetry, artifact hash gates on outputs — the LOTP intake supplies the abuse catalog |
| Memory residue (swap/hibernate) | memory remnants unexamined between boots | engine offline pass: `cau scan --swap <partition|image>` with the same one-read discipline; console IR mode schedules it with crash captures |
| Fleet identity continuity | sensor identity is long-lived IP; theft or collision is unhandled | identity key rotation with revocation windows, machine-id collision alerts at console, and revocation propagation checked in the same CI that tests update channels |

- [ ] Every row: kernel-asserted signal preferred, inferred labeled as inferred; the
  two ATT&CK-unmapped rows (BMC, memory residue) ship gap-marked like the packet guard's
  already do.
- [ ] Nothing here adds telemetry collection of content — devices, keys, configs and
  logs are inventoried as state, not read as payloads, keeping the privacy stance of the
  reporting rules intact.

## Device & USB plane — the full sweep

The gap-sweep row covered the entrée (first-seen inventory, HID grabber detection,
mount-time scan). This extends the device plane to its full extent, class by class, with
the same evidence-labeling and provenance rules. Most of what malware does over USB is behavior the host stack *can*
observe — this plane's job is to observe it on purpose.

| Surface | Attack class | Detection / control |
|---|---|---|
| HID keyboards | keystroke-injection hardware (automation cadence, not human typing) | inter-key timing uniformity metrics, typing during dead-silent sessions, HID descriptor anomalies (composite device with a vendor-specific class riding along) |
| HID without hardware | software-injected input via `uinput` | `uinput` module load and `/dev/uinput` node creation events, reconciled against package provenance |
| HID over Bluetooth | mousejacking / keystroke injection over unencrypted HID profiles | duplicate-event accounting (two sources feeding one device), BT HID posture — research-tier until validated |
| RNDIS / CDC-NCM NICs | plug-in rogue NIC → DHCP/RA MITM from the host's own L2 | USB-attached NIC first-seen + instant OFFER/RA activity from it (feeds the netguard rows) |
| Wi-Fi/BT radios on USB | attack-cable class (rogue radio built into a cable), hostile AP | first-seen radio inventory; concurrent AP-mode behavior on an unknown dongle alerts |
| Storage — autorun lineage | `.desktop` Exec keys, `.lnk` re-targeting, `autorun.inf` heritage | media scan runs *before* user opens anything; exec lines in mounted filesystems flag |
| Storage — hidden regions | HPA/DCO and vendor partitions beyond the declared logical size | geometry audit (interface-reported sectors vs partition table) plus a read-beyond-logical-end probe in IR mode |
| Storage — hidden data | payload in unallocated space / filesystem slack / bad blocks | `--device` full-disk offline pass (sibling of the `--swap` pass), scanning unallocated ranges deliberately |
| Storage — composite impersonation | emulated CD-ROM + MSD composites posing as installer media | composite-class storage flags unless provenance-pinned to a fleet-trusted vendor |
| Copy-out (DLP-lite) | bulk exfiltration to removable | write-volume telemetry, policy alerts; mount-class deny available through the BPF-LSM mount hook the kernel section already registers |
| Power Delivery / Type-C | BadPower-class contract abuse from chargers | `typec` / `power_supply` sysfs event taps: contract changes and unexpected PDOs logged per charger identity |
| USB stack abuse | `usbip` remote device injection, raw `/dev/bus/usb` readers | `usbip` disabled in posture with alerts on bind attempts; raw usbfs readers provenance-reconciled |
| Bus posture (DMA) | Thunderbolt/USB4 PCIe tunneling DMA, weak IOMMU | posture audit: IOMMU state, Thunderbolt security level, hotplug policy; IOMMU fault events tapped as DMA-attempt evidence — honest gap: no clean ATT&CK node exists, marked for submission |
| Class policy | anything-not-allow-listed reaches drivers | peripheral allow-list profiles: HID+storage+charging classes only by default; others sit `authorized=0` at udev with events logged |

- [ ] `internal/usbguard`: eBPF/udev/netlink taps, per-host first-seen inventory, the same
  "kernel-asserted vs inferred" labels as the packet guard.
- [ ] Device-first-seen nodes join the Threat Graph — "which process opened the new USB
  device" is a one-hop pivot, and a device followed by anomalous process behavior
  correlates automatically.
- [ ] Kernel postures land in the hardening-posture report class: default-deny device
  authorization, `usbip` off, IOMMU/TB security checks.
- [ ] Accepted limit, stated plainly: inline hardware keyloggers and bus-level analog
  interception are invisible to the host stack — they are asset-management problems, not
  detection problems, and the plan documents the boundary rather than pretending
  otherwise.

## Session-plane sweep — clipboard, capture and agent taps

The Phase 11 matrix covers persistence, execution and the network deeply but leaves the
*session* thin — the surface a human is actually touching. That is where credential-grade
secrets move and where most contemporary stealers operate, precisely because it is quiet
and personal.

| Surface | Attack class | Detection / control |
|---|---|---|
| Clipboard | capture-style stealers and wallet-address swap writes (T1115) | selection-event tap + write-diff: address-like text copied, a *different* address-like text pasted; clipboard-manager daemons reconciled against provenance |
| Screen | grab-and-stage: capture tooling from non-package parents, XRecord/XShm clients, scheduled screenshot jobs with no user action (T1113) | display-access process-set diffing — which processes hold a screen-grab interface in a session nobody is visibly using |
| Remote access | desktop-sharing software first-seen, and unused-but-listening installs (T1219) | x11vnc/wayvnc/rustdesk-class daemon inventory + outgoing-socket correlate at listen start; deny-by-default policy row for locked-down profiles |
| Audio | capture-stream holds: source-output registrations, raw capture-node opens (T1123) | audio-graph taps per consumer, first-seen per device node |
| Video | capture holds plus virtual-camera impersonation via `v4l2loopback` (T1125) | `/dev/video` open table vs package lineage; module-load alert for `v4l2loopback` itself |
| History | mid-session history tampering: `HISTFILE`/`HISTSIZE=0` runtime sets, history-file truncation diffs (T1070.003) | shell-event telemetry — evidence-labeled, because plenty of humans do this too; the label carries the load |
| Session-bus persistence | D-Bus activation-service drop-ins, polkit rules granting silent auth, activation Exec landing in user-writable paths (gap-marked — no clean ATT&CK node, submission candidate) | `/usr/share/dbus-1/services` + polkit rules diffs vs provenance |
| Agent sockets | SSH/gpg-agent socket rebinding and agent impersonation — key material harvested at use time (gap-marked; the nearest ATT&CK family isn't close) | `SSH_AUTH_SOCK` runtime-set telemetry, `$XDG_RUNTIME_DIR` socket diffing, extra agent instances spawned |
| Sleep hooks | suspend/resume persistence — `/etc/systemd/system-sleep` scripts; the resume window is a quiet, given edge (gap-marked) | sleep-hook dir inventory vs provenance, resume-time execution telemetry |
| udev rules | runtime-added `.rules` persistence — the device plane's own persistence gap, mirrored here (gap-marked) | rules-file diffs vs package provenance; non-package rules flag |

- [ ] `internal/sessiontap`: one sensor module registers the clipboard, capture, audio and
  video taps — plug-in so single-module registration keeps the agent-footprint sales
  point (Phase 7 #7) intact instead of creeping into per-device daemons.
- [ ] Honest anchoring: clipboard managers, screen-sharers, volume daemons and
  window-listeners are legitimately alive — analytics anchor on provenance and
  behavior bandwidth, never on "the tool is suspect" alone.
- [ ] Session-plane events join the Threat Graph: agent-socket replacement,
  address-swap clipboard writes and capture-before-exfil are one-hop pivots with
  compounding edge metadata.
- [ ] Capture-indicator honesty: host analytics see kernel-open holds; they cannot see
  or assert hardware states — the covered-camera question is posture advice, not
  detection, and the report says so.

---

## Cloud-adjacent planes — egress and transfer sweep

Cloud fleets silently face several planes the cross-system sweep hinted at but never
enumerated. Most rows already use classes CAU taps — the additions are destinations,
lineages and config diffs, not new telemetry volumes.

| Surface | Attack class | Detection / control |
|---|---|---|
| Cloud metadata | instance-metadata credential theft from workloads (T1552.005) | link-local metadata endpoints (169.254.169.254, fd00:ec2::254, 100.100.100.200, metadata.google.internal) alert unless the allowlisted agent process is the caller |
| Kubernetes node | ServiceAccount-token reads outside kubelet/containerd lineage, static-pod drop-ins, container-API credential stores (T1552.007) | token-file open table per lineage; manifest-dir diffs |
| Anonymization | anonymizer-LOTL C2 (T1090.003) | tor daemon first-seen + control-port listener; i2p router start; policy-gated inventory |
| Exfil-vacuum | first-seen cloud-transfer tooling (rclone/restic/borg) and scheduled-job retargeting (T1567.002) | transfer-tool inventory + destination-endpoint first-seen per host; schedule-edit events re-run the destination check |
| Egress config | DNS-plane tamper: resolv.conf/dnsmasq/systemd-resolved diffs, per-process DoH/DoT adoption, `http_proxy` config injection (extends the packet-layer guard) | config diffs vs provenance + "this process never spoke DoH before" analytics — a host whose DNS plane moved quietly can't see its own C2 |
| Git plane | repo-shipped hooks exec'ed on first interaction with a clone, smudge/clean filter exec, `core.fsmonitor` process exec (gap-marked — ATT&CK has no clean node; submission candidate) | git-config provenance diffs + repo-dir hook first-run telemetry; filters pointing at user-writable exec paths flag |
| Network file plane | exec from NFS/CIFS mounts, iscsi initiator retargeting (gap-marked) | mount-flag posture audit (noexec where policy says), per-exec mount-origin attribution, initiator config diffs |
| Language ecosystems | hook persistence beyond distro packaging — npm postinstall, pip `.pth` + `sitecustomize`, `setup.py`, cargo `build.rs`, `NODE_OPTIONS` (T1546.016 extension) | the same provenance-diff mechanics as the package-hook row, keyed per ecosystem |

- [ ] `internal/cloudplane`: the metadata tap and token-file table ship default-on for
  cloud fleets; token lineage reconciles against kubelet/containerd judgments first.
- [ ] Destination-endpoint inventory persists per-host exactly like device- and
  NIC-first-seen.
- [ ] Canary extension — honeycred: planted token-shaped strings in predictably-read
  credential stores, which only an attacker ever reaches; the zero-FP class of the
  canary-file primitive extends from files to credentials.

## Install-plane scanning — .sh at the moment it is read

Installer execution is the highest-value script plane on a host: dpkg/rpm scriptlets,
language-ecosystem hooks, and piped installs all run shell the moment software lands.
The engine's job is to make that the moment it watches hardest — knowable lineage
*before* exec, content analysis before any write lands.

| Surface | What the scanner does |
|---|---|
| exec-perm hold | `FAN_OPEN_EXEC_PERM` holds the open of every script spawned under a package-manager lineage (dpkg/apt/rpm/pacman/npm/pip/cargo children) until the engine renders a verdict — the script is scanned *before* exec completes |
| payload-ownership reconciliation | the engine resolves which package payload a script belongs to (dpkg database / rpmdb / local metadata, fully offline); scripts executed by installer children that no payload owns flag as install-time tampering |
| script-content analysis | the shell analyzer checks writes into persistence dirs (systemd, autostart, cron, udev, sleep hooks), authorized_keys appends, LD_PRELOAD exports, curl→exec patterns, encoded blobs, sudoers edits — findings carry the same evidence labels and FP lifecycle as everything else |
| pipe-delivered installs | `curl | bash` never opens a scannable file — the behavioral rule is lineage-level (network→pipe→shell), and the row says so honestly instead of pretending content capture happened |
| ecosystem hooks | dpkg postinst/preinst, RPM scriptlets, npm postinstall, pip `setup.py`, cargo `build.rs` feed the T1546.016 row: script-run events per ecosystem reconcile against the provenance store, never a static allowlist |

- [ ] `internal/shscanner`: parses shell scripts as data, not text blobs — an AST bound
  by the Phase 9 parse budgets, with the YARA module matching AST tokens rather than
  raw-text regex, so an obfuscated script that evades pattern-matching doesn't evade
  the structure view.
- [ ] Verdict semantics are explicit, never silent: hold-and-decide is the default on
  installer lineages; fleet profiles select hold-installer / hold-all / audit-only. The
  verdict deadline is configurable — fail-closed by default on installer lineages,
  fail-open-with-alert as an *explicit* fleet choice. A stalled installer never guesses.
- [ ] Offline-first: ownership resolution and content analysis run fully air-gapped — no
  cloud verdict dependency on the install path.
- [ ] FP rule mirrors the house rule: package-shipped scripts pass via payload
  ownership; user-local and piped scripts go through content analysis, not name
  allowlists. Pre-exec decisions are allow/flag/quarantine per fleet profile, each one
  labeled in the timeline.
- [ ] Honest edge, stated: scripts executed from `/proc/self/fd` or heredocs bypass
  file-open entirely — the covered detection there is lineage-level (installer child +
  exec-from-anon-fd is the alert surface), and coverage renders carry the gap-mark
  rather than implying content was seen.
- [ ] Timeline tie: "package X ran script S wrote file F" is one Threat-Graph pivot —
  the install plane feeds the same chain-evidence model, and CI benches the
  install-storm case (mass package bursts across many hosts) against the sensor budget
  and the event-loss policy, so scanning never becomes the queue's DoS.

---

## Installed-plane monitoring — packages, dependencies, quiet planes

Install-time scanning covers the moment software lands; this covers the rest of its
life. Two tables: the package/dependency plane, and the planes that routinely go
unmonitored because no agent product grew up around them.

**The package and dependency plane**

| Signal | Detection |
|---|---|
| Package lifecycle | install/remove/downgrade events reconciled against the provenance DB — downgrades alert by default, extending the anti-rollback row from release channel to the host's own package set |
| Installed-binary mutation | installed files hash-diffed against package manifests; mutation outside a package transaction is a tamper alert — the package DB still claims the older content |
| Dependency substitution | a binary's runtime library set diverging from its manifest's declared dependency set — the loader resolving libs from outside the owning package (dependency-hijack class; adjacent to the T1574 family, listed honestly as partial) |
| Vendored ecosystems | vendored trees (node_modules, cargo vendor, go vendoring) hashed against their lockfiles on the host — lockfile edits without the lock-owner process running flag |
| Uninstall scripts | prerm/postrm events scan symmetrically to postinst under the install-plane holds — the removal path is historically less watched |
| Package-DB integrity | dpkg status / rpmdb reads and writes outside a package transaction — the package *database itself* tampering to hide `(not-obviously-)owned` state |

**The quiet planes — nobody's floor**

| Surface | Why it matters | Detection |
|---|---|---|
| SUID/SGID drift | setuid/setgid bits on non-package paths — the classic privesc primitive is invisible in default agent telemetry | bit set/clear events + full inventory diff vs package manifests |
| Network hooks | NetworkManager dispatcher.d, ifup/ifdown.d, netplan drop-ins, wicked — network-state persistence | drop-in inventory vs package provenance |
| Print plane | CUPS filters and PPDs run as root on every print event — the printer as an execution plane | filter/PPD first-seen + payload-ownership reconciliation |
| Pager plane | LESSOPEN/LESSPIPE, man-db filters, groff — code that runs every time someone pages a file | pager-filter config diffs; env-change telemetry on the parent lineage |
| Portal grant plane | xdg-desktop-portal permission-store mutations — sandbox-piercing grants written without any visible transaction | permission-store diffs first-seen per app-id |
| Fontconfig drops | font parsers are a classic exploitation surface and font dirs are unmonitored everywhere | font/config drops outside fontconfig-owned dirs first-seen |
| /dev/shm | exec-class artifacts in shared memory — the dropper segment that never lands on disk | shm exec-class file events, reconciled against package lineage |
| hosts-file writes | the oldest name-redirection primitive, effectively unmonitored | `/etc/hosts` mutation outside package ownership |
| Alternatives & triggers | update-alternatives resolution and dpkg trigger registration — the quietly authoritative command-resolution layer | alternatives symlink-state diffs; trigger registration events |

- [ ] `internal/pkgmon`: package-database watch, manifest-diff engine, drift baselines
  backed by the Phase 7 #5 provenance DB; package transactions define the *legal
  namespace* — anything outside a transaction that touches installed state flags.
- [ ] Quiet-plane taps ride the existing sensor modules (fs, session, net taps) — no
  new daemons; every row lands in `cau selftest` and the fleet-health surfaces.
- [ ] Same FP lifecycle everywhere: CUPS, font and pager paths are owned by distro
  packages, so drift-by-payload-ownership keeps FPs near zero without name allowlists.
- [ ] Adoption honesty: "nobody monitors this" is a differentiation claim — these rows
  re-check against the inversion table's CI gate like everything else; a row whose
  claim decays renders as *partial* instead of holding.
- [ ] Performance honesty: quiet-plane taps are high-frequency surfaces (pager and
  print events alone can be busy on desktop fleets) — throughput budgets and the
  event-loss policy apply identically, benched in CI, and the drop-policy states *what
  sheds under a print storm*.

## Supply-chain defense — the top five package managers, and the harder-to-kill rule

Language ecosystems (npm, PyPI, cargo, go vendoring) already ride the T1546.016 and
vendored-tree rows. The five OS-level managers below get their own threat-specific
surfaces — their escape hatches differ, so the detection rows differ.

| Manager | Supply-chain threat shape it faces | Detection / control |
|---|---|---|
| APT / .deb | malicious-mirror metapackages, postinst persistence, unauthenticated-downgrade tricks | scriptlets through the install-plane hold; sources.list.d drop-in diffs per host; apt-keyring writes outside a package transaction alert (pairs with the trust-store row) |
| DNF / RPM | dnf plugin persistence, %post scriptlets, COPR/repo key churn, rpm key-import tricks | dnf plugin-dir diffs; rpm-keyring watch; scriptlets through the install-plane hold; `rpm --rebuilddb` and rebuild anomalies as package-DB tamper events |
| pacman / AUR | AUR PKGBUILDs execute arbitrary build code as root on every build; alpm hook drop-ins run pre/post transaction | makepkg/AUR-helper spawn is installer lineage — the hold-scan applies; alpm hook-dir diffs; `/etc/pacman.d` repo drop diffs |
| snap | lifecycle hooks (prepare/configure/remove), classic-snap command-chains, interface grants changing at install | snap hook inventory per snap-id vs store manifest; interface-grant audit events; snapd socket writes from unauthorized lineage |
| flatpak | override drop-ins relaxing sandbox permissions at `/var/lib/flatpak/overrides`, fake-Flathub app installs, portal grants | a permission-*relaxing* override write is an alert on its own; portal-grant events tie the grant row; export/commands dirs first-seen |

- [ ] Per-ecosystem provenance keys: the Phase 7 #5 provenance DB gains a keyring and
  source-list anchor class per manager, so repo/key changes can only come from package
  transactions — everything else is a first-class alert.
- [ ] The kill-attempt ledger gets its supply-chain row: any non-package-agent attempt
  to stop, disable, mask, or uninstall the sensor (systemd unit masks, package-manager
  removal of sensor packages, profile drop-ins disabling gates, binary deletion) is a
  first-class event — evidence is captured before the action lands.
- [ ] Harder-to-kill rule, honest form: the design goal is *harder to kill quietly*,
  not impossible to kill. Ring-0 attackers end userspace defenses by definition; what
  the plan claims is that every kill attempt leaves evidence that survives the kill —
  crash capture, kernel anti-tamper, and the independent aliveness monitor.
- [ ] No silent kill: selftest/aliveness failure renders the host *degraded* on the
  console, never dark. A dead sensor is a visible dead sensor.
- [ ] Self-heal with a floor: fleet policy may auto-reinstall the sensor package from
  the signed channel on unexpected removal; a second removal inside the window
  escalates the host. The claim is delay-and-evidence, not invincibility.
- [ ] Gate-resilience clause: the install-plane holds, payload-ownership checks and
  package-DB integrity watch all bind into the anti-tamper core — disabling any
  detection module counts as a kill attempt and rides the same ledger. Supply-chain
  defenses that can be quietly turned off are not defenses.
- [ ] Package-manager locks: sensor packages mark themselves protected with the host's
  own manager mechanisms; removal attempts coerce a console alert plus a fleet-policy
  response (host containment is an opt-in console action, never autonomous by default).

---

## Platform support policy — EOL operating systems retained

Commercial EDRs drop EOL distro support aggressively because it damps their support
cost. Large real fleets cannot upgrade on that clock. The product stays useful where the
hosts actually are — with honesty about what EOL means, and without laundering it
(addressed below in policy governance):

- [ ] Support tiers: *Frontline* (two newest LTS branches per major distro, full
  feature matrix), *Legacy/EOL* (at minimum two years beyond distro EOL: detection and
  sensor keep working, supported, packageable), *Retired* (documented per release in
  SUPPORT.md, never silently dropped between releases).
- [ ] Engine portability is the mechanism: static/musl builds with libyara bundled, so
  no distro glibc floor blocks an EOL host; deb/rpm packages for EOL distro versions
  ship with every release alongside the hash channel.
- [ ] Sensor kernel matrix explicitly includes EOL LTS kernels (4.19, 5.4, 5.10-class);
  BPF-CO-RE keeps one binary across them; DKMS covers the tails. Feature degradation per
  kernel is published in the matrix — never silent.
- [ ] EOL visibility, not EOL euphemism: reports flag hosts running an EOL OS with the
  distro's support state — in plain wording, per the free-reporting rules — but
  detection continues unaffected. The product never implies an EOL host is secure, and
  never offers to hide that flag (see policy governance).

# CAU Console — the paid multi-agent management tier

**The console is the only paid artifact, and it only *manages many agents*.**
License is per managed-agent tier (or per console deployment), enforced in the
console server alone. The agents themselves — all detection and all on-host
prevention — are free and unmetered. One console, four agent types; the console
coordinates and governs them, it does not add any detect-or-prevent capability
an agent lacks on its own.

## Agent types

**1. Sensor agents** — `cau-sensor`, resident. Everything stateful lives here: real-time
and scheduled scanning, filesystem/process event subscription, memory scanning, quarantine,
restore, process kill. *This is where Episodes 8+ (fileless, AMSI/ETW tampering, memory)
land, because it needs resident state the stateless CLI cannot keep.* **Free and
unmetered (MIT):** all detection and all on-host prevention — quarantine, restore, block,
kill — ship in the agent with no license check. The console only *manages* these agents;
it never unlocks a response the agent cannot already perform alone.

**2. Scan nodes** — `cau-scanner`, stateless container workers. Bulk scanning of repos,
CI pipelines, artifact stores, blob storage. Central queue, work-stealing, result cache
keyed by SHA256.

**3. AI/MCP analysis agents** — third-party or customer-built LLM agents consuming the OSS
MCP server. Console governs: registration, per-agent tool allowlists, rate limits, budget
caps, output sanitization (prompt-injection defense on agent results), quality scoring
against gold labels, revocation.

**4. Autonomous detection agents** — CAU-run. Continuously hunt: mine new samples, cluster
by imphash/TLSH, propose YARA and capa rules, propose quarantine. **Human-in-the-loop
approval gate.** A proposal is promoted only if it beats the incumbent on a held-out corpus
with measured FP/FN. The verification gate is the contribution, not the generation.

## Console surfaces

- **Fleet** — inventory across all four types, health, version pinning, staged/canary rollout
- **Policy** — hierarchical org → group → agent; policy-as-code; signed; audit-logged
- **Detection content** — signature + rule lifecycle, lint, test-before-promote with
  measured regression, one-click revert, ATT&CK coverage matrix
- **Incidents** — cross-agent-type correlation, ATT&CK-mapped timeline, triage, response actions
- **Agent governance** — permission scoping, budgets, immutable audit trail, injection-defense
  status, quality score
- **Model registry** — signed artifacts, model cards, temporal-generalization metrics, gate
- **Evasion telemetry** — fleet-wide evasion-distance trending; "which rule families are
  degrading under adversary pressure" is a dashboard no one else can draw
- **Reporting** — SARIF/JSON export, compliance, ATT&CK coverage

## Policy governance — no "risk accepted" mode

The console will not ship a permanent "risk accepted" state that silences detections.
That control is the most abused one in commercial EDR: exclusions become paths, paths
become implants, and the exclusion list outlives every review that approved it.

- [ ] Exclusions are objects with a lifetime: scope-bound (host, path, hash, process),
  named owner, reason, provenance-signed, time-boxed with a hard default cap, renewable
  only via re-executed approval. No silent allow-lists exist in any surface.
- [ ] Detections never skip during an exclusion window: findings still compute and are
  stored, reported as `excluded-by <id>` — suppressed, not erased. The audit trail keeps
  both the detection and the decision.
- [ ] Coverage honesty carries into governance: the fleet-wide exclusion report renders
  beside the ATT&CK matrix, because a detection engine whose output can be switched off
  by policy has not reported truth until it reports the policy too.
- [ ] Engine-side parallel (same rule the repo's own agents run under): eval gates and
  exit codes cannot be overriden by config — no `|| true` equivalent exists. The engine
  ignores any "accept findings" field; JSON/SARIF stay factual.
- [ ] The design stance: a product that accepts risks on behalf of its customers can be
  made to blind itself; this one refuses the state instead of gating it.

## Licensing mechanics

- **Detection and prevention are free and unmetered — there is no per-host charge.**
  The agent (all detection plus all on-host response: quarantine, restore, block, kill,
  canaries) is MIT and carries no license check at all. Metering a host, or gating any
  response action, is explicitly forbidden: it would punish the exact capability that
  makes the agent worth deploying.
- **The only metered thing is the multi-agent management console.** License enforcement
  lives solely in the closed-source console server — the pane that manages a fleet. If a
  license check appears in the agent or the engine it is a bug; it will be stripped and
  it protects nothing the free agent doesn't already give away.
- Charging shape: the management console is licensed per deployment, or tiered by the
  number of agents it manages, and multi-tenancy is priced per tenant — exact numbers
  stay in `pricing.toml` (Phase 7 #4), never in prose.
- 1-year term with managed-agent tiers; air-gapped renewal path for regulated buyers.

### Paid surface (the multi-agent management GUI — and nothing else)

- **The fleet management console is the one paid surface, paid by design, not crippled
  into it.** The web GUI that runs *many agents* from one pane — fleet inventory, central
  policy distribution, cross-host incident timelines, fleet-scale detection-content
  lifecycle, governance surfaces — runs only from the licensed console. A single agent
  (and the CLI, JSON/SARIF output, MCP tools, eval harness, and *all on-host prevention*)
  stays complete and free: a lone operator pays nothing and loses nothing, including the
  ability to block, quarantine and kill.
- **Multi-tenancy is part of that same surface.** Org → group → host hierarchy, tenant
  isolation and quota, RBAC/SSO, and cross-tenant pivoting are console-licensed. The
  agent has no tenant concept — single-host by design — so the paywall lives on
  inherently stateful, multi-agent server-side capability, not on feature-caps in the
  agent or engine.
- The boundary is structural: a paid feature must be something the free agent
  *cannot host alone* — coordination across many agents — never a detection or
  prevention capability withheld from a single host. That is what keeps the split honest
  at renewal time.

### Free reporting — normal commercial use

- [ ] Basic reporting is free and MIT for any commercial use: per-run artifacts — text,
  JSON, SARIF — with per-file verdicts, heuristic category breakdowns, and YARA matches
  with rule meta. No license gates, no phoning home, no watermarking in report content.
- [ ] Neutral wording inside artifacts: reports record tool name, version, engine
  thresholds and per-file data in plain professional language, suitable for CI runs and
  audit handoff ("what was checked, why this verdict"). The CLI banner and tagline are
  stderr persona only and never enter report artifacts; machine formats were already
  banner-free by design (`finish()` writes a document even on failed runs).
- [~] Linux-first packaging for normal commercial deployment: deb/rpm packages with the
  engine at the standard paths (resources under `/usr/share/cau`, config under
  `/etc/cau` — matching the existing discovery order), man pages, shell completions,
  and a systemd timer unit for scheduled scans writing reports to a configurable
  directory.
  **Automated background run shipped 2026-11-02:** `cau scan --interval <dur>` is a
  self-contained scan daemon (re-scans on the interval, writes the report each cycle,
  exits 0 on `SIGTERM`), and `packaging/systemd/` ships both patterns — a timer-driven
  one-shot (`cau-scan.service` + `cau-scan.timer`) and a resident daemon
  (`cau-daemon.service`), hardened units writing to a configurable report dir, with a
  README covering `--quarantine` and the Windows/`launchd` wrappers. It is a *scheduled*
  scanner; real-time kernel monitoring stays the sensor's.
  **Status 2026-11-06:** the Debian package (`debian/`), the Arch PKGBUILD, both man
  pages and the three completion scripts exist and are installed by `make install`.
  **RPM spec added** (`packaging/rpm/cau.spec`): offline build from the release tarball
  and `vendor/`, the Makefile's own install targets, a `%check` that runs the packaged
  binary, units installed and never enabled. Built here with `rpmbuild --nodeps` on a
  Debian-family host (builds, self-check passes, file list complete). **Open:** it has
  not been built or installed on an RPM distribution, where the build dependencies and
  the systemd scriptlet macros actually resolve, and no CI job builds it.
- [ ] The free/paid reporting boundary rides the single-agent vs. multi-agent line:
  anything a single agent can emit about its own host — per-run artifacts, its local
  history, its own prevention/response record — is free; only *cross-agent* rollups
  (fleet-wide views, cross-tenant pivoting) are a console surface. Same structural rule
  the paid-surface section enforces — reporting introduces no artificial cripples, and
  detection and prevention are never on the paid side of the line.

## Sequence

Phase 0-2 (fork fixes, harness, episodes 4/5/6) → Phase 3 (MCP) → Phase 4 (intel + content
lifecycle) → Phase 5 (ML) → Phase 6 (evasion suite) → Phase 7 (credibility bets: items 1-4
can start immediately on the OSS assets; 5-10 land inside Console Phases A-B) → Phases
8-9 (firmware/boot-chain and the blind-spot sweep, interleaved with Console A) → Phase 10
(novel-technique detections — content work, starts immediately) → Phase 11 (Linux ATT&CK
coverage matrix, driven by the same corpus) → Console
Phase A (fleet + policy + detection lifecycle, shippable paid tier) → Console Phase B
(incident + response) → Console Phase C (autonomous agents + model registry).

MCP and the evasion suite are the OSS credibility plays. They make the engine worth
adopting and they are the two things a commercial EDR will never publish.

---

## Blind-spot inversion — their thin spots, then ours again

Two directions, both honest: the classes the wider detection market has historically
left thin, each claimed against the row of this plan that owns it (so differentiation
stays checkable against the plan, not against vibes), and a third round of self-audit
on what this plan still doesn't have after every sweep above.

**Their thin spots → our rows**

| Class | Where other stacks historically stay thin | Row here that owns it |
|---|---|---|
| Linux-native persistence | endpoint products tuned to Windows telemetry treat Linux surfaces generically | the full Phase 11 matrix + the session/cloud sweeps |
| Boot-chain and firmware | usually not an endpoint product at all — a separate SKU or outsourced | Phase 8 |
| Runtime-provenance verification | SBOM tooling produces manifests; sensors rarely verify them against running state | provenance DB (Phase 7 #5) |
| CI/CD and ephemeral workloads | per-host agent models assume long-lived machines | cross-system sweep + orchestrator plane |
| Cross-host L2 corroboration | per-host views only; IP→MAC churn is rarely correlated fleet-wide | Threat Graph (Phase 7 #8) |
| Document stego / fileless | signature engines skip both; behavior engines skip the first | NOVEL rows (Phase 10) |
| Kernel-BPF implants | agents that are themselves eBPF rarely audit hostile BPF | kernel section's bpffs/pinned-state inventory |
| Self-attestation | agents rarely attest their own runtime integrity | hardware-anchor section |
| Hardware-witnessed endpoint identity | MAC/hostname spoofing checked in software only | NIC permanent-MAC row |
| EOL OS continuity | support matrices drop EOL distros years before fleets do | platform support policy |
| Honest coverage reporting | "all detections" pillars with nothing behind them | `cau coverage` gap-marks and the Phase 1 gates |

**Ours still open — round three of the self-audit**

| Open row | Why it's a gap | Ask |
|---|---|---|
| Rename-storm cadence | mass permission/ownership alerts exist; the canonical ransomware tripwire — rapid rename/extension mutation on data directories — is absent | write-volume + rename-cadence detector in the behavior engine, measured in Phase 1 |
| Provenance beyond packaging | the provenance DB anchors distro packages; npm/cargo/pip installs, snap/flatpak/appimage, vendored and hand-built binaries have no anchor classes — the language-ecosystem sweep row silently depends on them | extend Phase 7 #5 with per-ecosystem anchor classes |
| Event-vault at-rest crypto | console hardening covers auth, supply and anti-rollback; the event store's at-rest encryption and key rotation is never stated | console-vault row in the hardening section |
| Retention and data governance | retention windows, subject-rights workflow, deletion propagation for sensor/behavior metadata: unplanned | data-governance row — retention policy and deletion paths tested like code |
| IR playbook library | the console ships response APIs; no operational playbook content rides the top Linux detections | pre-written runbook pack per top-20 detection, versioned and reviewed like detection content |
| `cau selftest` | a sensor can fall out of coverage silently — tap dead, BPF misload, kernel-gated, clock skew | one-command self-verification rendered in the console and gating fleet health |
| Release architecture matrix | the build matrix ships amd64; arm64 is implied, riscv64 uncommitted | architecture matrix in the release workflow, gates equal across arches |

- [ ] The inversion table is re-checked against the live coverage matrix at the same CI
  gate: a "thin spot" whose owning row regresses to planned/none re-opens the claim, so
  differentiation statements age with the product instead of rotting into marketing.

## The path to ten — category, not scoreboard

On the commercial-EDR board a ten is unwinnable without becoming that vendor — fleet-years,
install-base and data opacity are structural. So the ten lives on a different board: the
YARA/Sigma/Zeek outcome, becoming the layer the field plugs into rather than the product
that wins their scoreboard. Four components, each with its reason incumbents can't follow:

| Component | What it is | Why incumbents can't follow |
|---|---|---|
| Third-party scoring gate | the Phase 1 harness accepts external engines, Sigma-class rule packs and vendor coverage claims; per-technique FP/FN and evasion-distance publish for whoever submits | entering means publishing numbers their franchise has never published; staying out means being measured anyway |
| Prevalence co-op | opt-in class-level behavioral telemetry federation — taxonomy only, no content, no endpoint names, retention contract written before any data flows | a data moat built from openness: participants join because they own their data, not because they were locked in |
| Honesty-index instrument | free-reporting rules rendered as a scriptable index (coverage gap-marks, measured FP, selftest health) that buyers, auditors and insurers can run themselves | transparency becomes procurement infrastructure; trust-based channels can't follow without confessing on themselves |
| Substrate posture | engine as an embeddable detection layer (appliances, gateways, SIEM packs, CI platforms) plus the MCP agentic surface | complements get helped by vendors in ways competitors never are |

The data axis flips from sensor-years (time × agents installed) to environment-hours
(breadth of environments × runs per day) — CI- and ephemeral-native collection is the one
axis where open beats installed-agent fleets without needing their scale.

- [ ] Third-party submissions pipeline: signed manifests, the same CI gates, a published
  scoreboard. The one thing that must never happen is refusing to measure an engine that
  shows up — the index's value is precisely that it measures everyone who enters.
- [ ] Co-op governance: the free-reporting privacy rules apply to federation itself; a
  co-op drifting into a data broker is a named failure mode in the governance section.
- [x] Honesty-index v0: render coverage, Phase 1 results and selftest health into a
  single scriptable artifact now; v1 adds the third-party columns.
  **Shipped 2026-11-06** as `cau honesty` (`internal/honesty`, `cmd_honesty.go`): one
  JSON / text / markdown document with three sections (coverage against the committed
  expectation, an evaluation report, the selftest baseline), each with its own state,
  and a `not_claimed` list. No composite score, by design and by test (the key set is
  pinned). The smoke corpus is labelled synthetic from its manifest and its recall is
  called a plumbing check; a missing integrity baseline is `no-baseline`, not a pass;
  an evaluation report whose totals do not follow from its samples is an `error`.
  Byte-identical with `--no-timestamp`. On this tree today: coverage matches, the
  evaluation is the synthetic smoke report, and selftest is `no-baseline` because no
  `integrity.json` is committed. The index itself is not signed.
- [~] Substrate track: an embedding guide plus a stable detection-API contract; the MCP
  surface grows coverage and eval tools next to the scan tools.
  **MCP half shipped 2026-11-07:** `cau-mcp` gained `honesty_index`, `eval_report`,
  `peel_file`, `firmware_image`, `boot_scan`, `hardware_identity` (redacted by default)
  and a `frameworks` option on `mitre_coverage` (the Unified Kill Chain view), the
  `cau://honesty` resource and a `boot_chain_review` prompt: 15 tools, all read-only,
  all bounded, all confined to `--root` (a client cannot point the server at the live
  `/sys` unless the operator put it in the roots), with end-to-end JSON-RPC tests on
  synthetic fixtures. `cau defend`, `cau net` and the quarantine are deliberately not
  exposed. **Open:** the embedding guide and a stable detection-API contract.
- [ ] Honest boundary: this path's schedule is market-gated, not code-gated — adoption,
  not engineering, is the limiting resource. The ten-path runs parallel to
  closing-the-loop and never replaces shipping the boxes.

---

---

## Standards program — writing the bar, not meeting it

The ten-path defines becoming the layer the field plugs into; this defines what "plugged
in" means concretely: specifications CAU publishes that are *stricter than industry
practice*, each shipping with a conformance suite from day one — because a standard
nobody can test is marketing.

| Standard | What it sets | Industry state | Artifact + conformance |
|---|---|---|---|
| Detection-evidence contract | every shipped detection carries a provenance manifest, model card, per-technique FP/FN, last-measured date, bypass-regression state | vendor content ships with nothing comparable public | manifest schema + validator any vendor can run against their own content |
| Evidence-class labels | telemetry stratified by derivation: kernel-asserted / subsystem-confirmed / inferred, per event class | surveys count signals; nobody labels how each was derived | label schema + cross-check suite |
| Coverage honesty | gap-marks, planned/partial/detected states, no-padding render rules | coverage claims are marketing artifacts | `cau coverage` spec + independent re-checker |
| TTD metric | per-technique time-to-detect published with measurement conditions | eval programs measure it; vendors don't publish per-technique | open TTD harness spec + fixtures |
| Evasion-distance | per-technique, measured against the regression corpus, signed | not measured publicly anywhere | no precedent — the spec is written wherever it is invented |
| Event-loss accounting | drops by class with the fairness policy, published per sensor build | silent drops are the industry default | drop-account schema, verified by the CI benchstat runs |
| Eval-interchange fixtures | blue/red paired synthetic corpus format, versioned, license-clean, importable into other harnesses | eval corpora are private or ad-hoc | fixture-pack spec + importers; Sigma pairing where shapes overlap |
| Sensor-health contract | `selftest` schema: taps-alive, BPF-loaded, kernel-gates, clock-skew, hwanchor state as a readiness surface | agents ship health checks with no open contract | selftest schema + console/helm probe integration |
| Event-transparency profile | per-class privacy boundary + retention contract as machine-readable config, the free-reporting rules encoded | privacy posture ships as a PDF | profile schema + policy evaluator |

- [ ] `specs/` directory: every standard is a versioned spec document plus a reference
  validator, semvered so adopters never churn.
- [ ] Conformance as the credibility engine: the same suite that gates CAU's CI runs
  as `cau verify-spec <artifact>` — adopters self-test without shipping anything here.
- [ ] Adoption track: three early integrations per spec (one SIEM sink, one fleet tool,
  one eval harness) landed through the co-op's open-governance route, never through
  NDA-style silence.
- [ ] Interop anchoring: every spec imports and exports Sigma, STIX/TAXII and ECS where
  they overlap — strictness is layered on the norms that exist, never cut off from them.
- [ ] Honest boundary: a standard only CAU meets is a requirement, not a standard.
  Adoption re-checks ride the same CI gate as the inversion table — a spec whose only
  passing conformance is CAU's own regresses to "requirement," and the coverage
  render says so in place of the claim.

## Detection-methodology rating — versus industry practice

Industry methodology decomposes into four instruments: ATT&CK Evaluations-style
emulation scoring (external, technique-level, per-behavior), the telemetry-survey axis
(EDR-Telemetry-Project-style breadth mapping), commercial engine labs
(AV-Comparatives/SE-Labs style detection-rate testing with FP weighting), and vendor
internal regression corpora — the thing most products actually gate on. Honest grades
for this plan's execution at the done-right standard:

| Axis | Industry practice | CAU at standard | Grade |
|---|---|---|---|
| Coverage definition | technique matrices, Windows-clean, mostly post-hoc | full Linux matrix with per-technique analytic owner + gap-marks | A on Linux; nothing comparable market-wide |
| Validation independence | external emulation ranges running adversary traces | own synthetic blue/red fixtures, CI-gated | B — below the evals' standard until the third-party scoring gate lands |
| Content regression | vendor-internal corpora, rarely per-merge | every merge CI-measured against the bypass corpus; eval regressions fail releases | A — stricter than common practice |
| FP accounting | lab-tested and weighted, opaque per-technique | per-technique FP/FN numbers published | A |
| Evasion-distance | not measured publicly by vendors | published per technique | A — no industry precedent to follow |
| Telemetry honesty | survey taxonomy | kernel-asserted/inferred labels + drop accounting | A — stricter |
| Behavior-model maturity | fleet-scale incident corpora | small-corpus, planned Phase 5 ladder | C+ — honest until fleet-years |
| Prevention efficacy | graded axis (block vs detect) | detection-first with quarantine | C — a parallel axis, owned honestly |
| Time-to-detect | measured latencies, headline numbers | no per-technique TTD metric planned | C — addable, listed below |
| Environment diversity | multi-OS and multi-version emulation matrix | kernel/glibc spread only thinly planned | B- — fixtures matrix needed |

- [ ] Per-technique time-to-detect joins the Phase 11 renderings — it is the industry's
  headline number and the plan currently doesn't say it.
- [ ] A fixtures matrix across kernel/glibc/architecture variants joins Phase 1, so the
  environment-diversity row moves from B- to A at eval time.
- [ ] The third-party scoring gate is simultaneously the independence fix — the same
  component moves both rows that grade below B.

---

---

## Detection-quality program — improving the rows that already exist

The sweeps added planes; this program improves the *quality* of detection on every
plane — the gap between "a row exists in the matrix" and "the row fires at its target
FP/FN in production" is where detection programs actually live or die.

| Improvement | What it changes | Tie-in |
|---|---|---|
| Detection fusion lattice | independent weak analytics fuse into one score — beating one detector costs little; beating a fusion of sources costs multiplicatively, since each layer must be evaded separately with uncorrelated errors | behavior engine (Phase 5) + eval gates |
| Fleet-relative behavioral novelty | "first-seen *in this fleet*" as an analytic, not just per-host first-seen: a process behavior on 2 hosts of 1000 outranks the same behavior fleet-wide-ubiquitous — FP suppression and novel-threat detection in one move | Threat Graph (Phase 7 #8), prevalence tables |
| Detection-liveness program | per-module synthetic signal injection (each tap must echo a signed canary event end-to-end) + fleet canary hosts running periodic full-pipeline checks — a silently broken pipeline becomes visible in minutes, not at the incident | `cau selftest`, aliveness monitor |
| Retro-sweep on intel updates | newly-landed detection content re-scans the recent local backlog (recent scannables, recent telemetry) so a rule catches up on history instead of only firing forward — with the retro-window size and the catch-up quarantine results rendered | Phase 4 content lifecycle, quarantine primitives |
| Verdict feedback ledger | analyst dispositions (TP/FP/benign-true) feed per-detection calibration with published FP/FN trend lines; dispositions are class-level metadata, never content | console surfaces, detection-debt metric |
| Governed suppressions | recurring benign patterns can be silenced — as *expiring, signed, audited benign-pattern contracts* with mandatory quarterly re-review. A suppression is a benign-class annotation, never a malice-acceptance, and the governance section gains exactly this clause so it can't become a bypass surface | no-risk-accepted rule (Policy governance) |
| Temporal baselining | circadian and work-period-aware confidence weighting — same behavior at 3am and at 14:00 on a Tuesday is not the same signal on a workstation fleet | agent types, per-agent-type eval weights |
| Privileged script telemetry | command-line capture for root/sudo lineages only, opt-in per fleet profile with full privacy accounting — Linux's missing PowerShell-script-block equivalent, scoped honestly | session plane, privacy rules |
| Evasion-cost curves | per-detection published cost-of-evasion curves from the bypass corpus — what an attacker must spend (time, primitives, surface) to retain attack value — detection economics instead of "detected/not detected" | Phase 6 evasion suite, Phase 11 renderings |
| Streaming scan plan | chunked, resumable scan of multi-GB files in the write path with hard budget caps — large-file handling stops being a timeout race and becomes a scheduled, interruptible stream | engine budget gates (Phase 1) |

- [x] The lattice — shipped 2026-10-25 as `scanner/fusion` (engine detectors live under
  `scanner/`), computed by the engine for every scan as `ScanResult.Fusion`. Inputs are
  the per-detector results with their evidence labels (`static/packer.upx`,
  `heuristic/process-injection`, `stego.zero-width`, `yara/<ns>/<rule>`), each with its
  ATT&CK technique (heuristic categories gained a technique map for this) and NOVEL id.
  Model: ratio = score/threshold capped at 1.5; the strongest scored source counts in
  full, every other source at or above floor 0.4 corroborates at weight 0.5; definitive
  sources (hash, YARA) are never downgraded. Fused ≥ 1.0 is SUSPICIOUS; the verdict
  lists every source with a role (definitive / primary / corroborating / below-floor /
  silent / skipped) so silence is explained as well as agreement, and `corroborated`
  marks detections no single detector made. Fuzzy-hash matches are their own
  `similarity` source, per the Phase 2 note. Rendered in text, JSON 1.2.0 (`fusion`),
  SARIF (`fusion/corroborated`), the exit policy (`--fail-on heuristic`), and the
  `fusion` eval detector, which reports *only* corroborated-only detections so the
  per-detector table shows the lattice's own contribution. Measured on the 349-file
  Kali Windows tool set: 0 fused-only detections, 0 new false positives; nearest benign
  near-miss is `wget.exe` (static 7/8, no second source above the floor). Monotonicity
  (raising any input never lowers score or tier) is a randomized test. Honest note: on a
  set the individual thresholds were tuned against, cross-source sub-threshold evidence
  rarely co-occurs, so the lattice's gain is pinned by synthetic fixtures today and must
  be re-measured on the first real corpus (Phase 1's open item).
- [ ] `internal/novelty`: fleet-relative first-seen persists per behavior-class key;
  the novelty ledger feeds the Threat Graph like the device and NIC inventories do.
- [ ] Canaries are content, not code: the canary event generator ships in the detection
  content pack, signed like every other pack item, so liveness checks rot as slowly
  as the detections they verify.
- [ ] Measure or don't ship: no improvement lands without per-detection before/after
  numbers on the same Phase 1 fixtures — the counter-claims (FP reduced, FN unchanged,
  latency flat) published where the detection's model card lives. Applied to the two
  rows above: fusion before/after on windows-resources is 28 → 28 heuristic, 0 → 0
  static, 0 fused-only; stego FP 0.10 % on 70k benign text artifacts; the smoke
  baseline was re-recorded with the new detectors and the gate stays green.
- [ ] Governance seam, written down once: benign-pattern contracts satisfy the
  no-risk-accepted rule *by construction* — they annotate benign patterns and expire;
  anything that would silence true-positive classes is, by definition, not a
  suppression and goes through the incident-and-response surface instead.

## Design-debt audit — flaws in this plan's own architecture

Coverage gaps are easy to add; this section is the harder pass — reviewing the plan
against itself. Eight design flaws exist in the current architecture as written. Each
stays a flaw until a design fixes it, not a paragraph.

**1. Event-model drift from module sprawl.** Ten-plus internal modules
(`netguard`, `usbguard`, `sessiontap`, `pkgmon`, `exploitledger`, `hwanchor`, `echolane`,
`garlic`, …) now feed the "one internal event model" claim. Left unspecified, they
drift into per-module formats and re-fragment the model the plan keeps citing.
Fix: a typed event-model registry — every module ships its event schema family plus a
conformance suite against the registry in CI, or it doesn't merge. The sink matrix
stays single-source at the registry, not at the promise.

**2. Tap-sum footprint.** Session taps, quiet-plane taps, install holds, transport
taps, ledger taps — each individually budgeted, jointly unaccounted. The RSS ceiling
and throughput budgets are per-program, not per-host-sum. Fix: a tap governor — every
tap declares its volume class (low/high/burst), per-class rate shaping with labeled
loss, and the *sum* flat-capped per host with shedding order published. The
agent-footprint sales point (Phase 7 #7) survives only if the sum is measured.

**3. No policy compiler.** Fleet profiles, class policies, allow-lists, thresholds,
hold deadlines, retention contracts, transport-ladder defaults — each feature invented
its own config surface. Config sprawl with divergent semantics is how "profiles" stop
meaning anything. Fix: one typed, signed policy schema with per-feature manifests and
explicit precedence rules; agent-types, fleet profiles and tenant hierarchy normalize
through it rather than each having private knobs.

**4. Update-in-flight semantics are unspecified.** Signed release channels and
anti-rollback exist; what happens *during* a sensor replacement does not — a watch-gap
mid-update is exactly the window an attacker wants. Fix: drain-and-handoff — the old
sensor drains its queue, the tap set hands over with no-watch-gap asserted by selftest,
receipts are version-tagged, and a failed handoff rolls back atomically.

**5. The sensor's privilege model is unspecified.** Most taps need capability (exec-perm
hold, XDP, kcore reads, flash-write taps) — but the plan never partitions privilege
inside the sensor itself. One watcher holding everything means one compromise holds
everything. Fix: a privilege-partitioned helper tree — capability sets declared per
tap, separate helper processes sized to their cap set, kill-scoped blast radius, and
the engine's decision path never reachable from any single helper.

**6. The self-heal / NOVEL-005 irony.** Our own row flags exclusive-tenancy wars —
agents killing other agents. Our self-heal mechanic (auto-reinstall on remove) is
behaviorally indistinguishable from that war *to other agents watching us*. Fix:
self-heal is open by label — reinstall only from the customer's configured channel,
rate-limited, profile opt-in, and emitting a `fleet-policy self-heal` event every time
so other agents observing us see policy, not a fight. Our NOVEL-005 detector should be
able to accept our own behavior by those labels alone.

**7. Local evidence is tamperable before transport.** Encrypted spool covers console
delivery; the on-host event journal itself can be deleted or edited by root before any
of it ships. Fix: an append-only, hash-chained local evidence journal — TPM-sealed
head via the hardware-anchor row, deletion or edit attempts are ledger events in
their own right, and the journal survives the kill attempts that the harder-to-kill
rule says must leave survivable evidence.

**8. Field FP is unmeasured.** Every FP number in the plan is fixture-derived. Synthetic
blue/red pairs test the generator's realism, not the fleet's — the methodology-rating
section's "field-FP calibration" gap remains. Fix: the prevalence co-op becomes the
calibration instrument — opt-in, class-level production FP measured per fleet-class,
published against the fixture numbers so each detection's model card carries *both*
(claimed and observed). Where they diverge, the divergence is the headline, not a
footnote.

- [ ] Registry, governor, policy compiler: three design docs land in `specs/` (they
  qualify as standards-program items: event-model registry, tap-governor contract,
  typed policy schema), each with a conformance suite — the standards program is the
  enforcement mechanism, not another label.
- [ ] The flaw-to- acceptance mapping: every design deck item above becomes a checkbox
  in the phase that owns it (kernel → #7 journal; console → #6 labels; Phase 1 → #2
  measurement), so the audit is scheduled rather than admired.
- [ ] CI: neither event-model conformance, tap-governor sum caps, nor policy-schema
  validation pass until their suites exist — new modules land *with* their schema,
  never behind it.
- [ ] Honesty line: the audit itself is re-run each release cycle; a fixed flaw stays
  fixed only if its conformance suite stays green — design debt has a gate now, not
  just a list.

## Performance-gap sweep — the contracts that are still missing

Phase 1 gates throughput, memory and timeouts; closing-the-loop §2 budgets per-hook
overhead and pipeline SLOs; the tap-governor caps the per-host sum. What's still
missing is the contract *per domain* — the performance work that has no number yet:

| Domain | Missing performance contract | The ask |
|---|---|---|
| Scan-result cache | no verdict cache exists — node_modules-scale trees re-scan identical content endlessly | content-hash verdict cache with pack-update invalidation (retro-sweep interplay), bounded size, hit-rate published |
| Engine worker pool | scan parallelism and I/O strategy unplanned | mmap/page-cache-friendly IO, worker pools sized under the memory ceilings, per-worker memory budgets |
| Event aggregation | the drop policy sheds under load but nothing *shrinks* load honestly | coalescing of identical repeated events into labeled aggregate events with counts — volume reduction without lying |
| Boot-window coverage | nothing measures how fast the sensor is *covering* after boot; pre-attach events are lost silently | time-to-covered per platform as a published metric; honest backfill via journald where available, gap-marked where not |
| Ephemeral attach latency | containers/CI runners churn faster than traditional fleets | container start-to-protected latency measured per runtime, CI-storm case benched |
| Ruleset compile budget | YARA/ruleset load time and pack size unplanned | compile-time and pack-size budgets, delta pack updates, incremental compile on hot reload |
| Console query SLOs | pivot/graph queries have no latency contract | graph-query latency caps, precomputed aggregates, pagination — the analyst console must answer in interactive time at fleet scale |
| Vault economics | retention/compaction/index growth unplanned | partitioned indexes, compaction schedules, storage caps with retention contracts enforced |
| PQC overhead | garlic/echo-lane require hybrid E2E per sink; ML-DSA receipts are *large* — unpriced | bytes+CPU per crypto op published per event class, receipt batching where signature size dominates |
| QUIC reconnect storms | ephemeral fleets reconnect constantly; handshake cost unpriced | anti-amplification rules, handshake caches, 0-RTT bounded by receipt pinning (no 0-RTT replay credit) |
| Per-arch parity | the arch matrix ships but performance parity is untested | the same SLO table per architecture — riscv64's honest delta published, not hidden behind one number |
| Fleet-scale soak | console horizontally-scaling knobs never exercised | nightly simulated-fleet soak (10k hosts) with scaling curves published *before* they're needed |

- [ ] `cau bench`: one harness, every domain registers a scenario, benchstat artifacts
  per run, regressions fail like any gate — the multi-domain gap closes only if
  measurement is one convention, not twelve.
- [ ] Bench-versus-fleet honesty: CI-runner numbers and real-fleet numbers are
  published side by side — the canary-host program (detection-liveness) doubles as the
  performance-canary fleet running synthetic load, with per-class p50/p99 reported.
- [ ] Kernel-side budgets land explicitly: BPF map memory caps, program-size and
  verifier limits, measured per-program attach cost — the kernel plane's performance
  budget is a document, not a hope.
- [ ] Crypto-DoS joins the coin side: repeated KEM-handshake forcing is rate-capped
  the way peel DoS was, with the same fairness model.
- [ ] Every number lands on the model-card surfaces the plan already publishes — no
  performance claim without its measurement conditions, per the standards program.

---

## Closing the loop — the four limits, owned

The plan's own critique surfaces four standing limits. Each gets a workstream rather
than a wish, and progress lands in the coverage artifact so it is measured, not promised.

**1. Detection-content supply (the open-matrix problem).**
The Phase 4 intake sources content; what it lacks is the *operations loop* that turns
open matrix rows into shipped detections:
- [ ] One open row = one tracked issue = one PR. Every merged detection lands with its
  model card and Phase 1 FP/FN numbers attached. "Detection debt" — open rows and the
  trend per release — is a published metric, not a private TODO.
- [ ] Generation assists, never ships: the Phase 5 Tier-3 LLM analyst and corpus-cluster
  rule drafts enter through the same gates as everything else — generated, gated,
  human-reviewed. There is no fast lane around Phase 1.
- [ ] Community contribution path: external rule PRs sign the same provenance manifest,
  with a standing revert contract — a contributed rule that costs FPs is pulled in the
  same CI cycle that introduced it, which is what keeps contributions safe to accept at
  scale.

**2. Latency and throughput (sensor runtime).**
Phase 1 budgets the engine and the eval; the sensor runtime needs its own explicit
numbers:
- [ ] Hook-overhead budget: every BPF-LSM/eBPF program documents its per-event cost in
  the source header; CI benches regressions with benchstat deltas and publishes
  flamegraph artifacts. Regressions fail the build like any other gate.
- [ ] Event-pipeline SLO: sustained-ingest target measured on the CI-runner baseline,
  with a published event-loss policy — drop classes are accounted, never silent, per the
  evidence-labeling rule. Under pressure the plan says *what sheds*, not aim silently.
- [ ] Memory ceilings: the sensor RSS cap is enforced and surfaced, because the
  agent-footprint argument (Phase 7 #7) only survives if it is measured.

**3. The product's own CVE credibility.**
- [ ] `SECURITY.md`, coordinated disclosure with embargo; `govulncheck` runs with
  lint/build/test in the CI stage; SBOM is consumed, not only produced, so CAU's own
  dependencies live under the same supply gates it enforces elsewhere.
- [ ] A bypass of this product, when found, lands as a regression fixture the same day
  as its fix — the Phase 11 bypass-corpus rule runs at CAU first.

**4. The internal-corpus dependency.**
- [ ] Every publicly planned detection names its public evidence source (MISP, abuse.ch,
  LOLDrivers, the LOTL catalogs, synthetic fixtures). The internal corpus steers the
  *priorities*; it never funds a public claim. Where no public twin of an internal
  detection exists, the row stays gap-marked in the coverage matrix instead of shipping
  a number the repo cannot itself support.

## Browser & extension plane — the biggest unmonitored exec surface on workstations

The session sweep covered clipboard, capture and agent sockets. The browser is a
separate plane: it is the single largest sandboxed-execution surface on most
workstations, extensions can read and write every page, and MV3 did not close the
plane — it reshaped it. Everything here is state and provenance, never page content.

| Surface | Attack class | Detection / control |
|---|---|---|
| Extension inventory | sideloaded/dev-mode extensions, policy-force-installed extensions outside the enterprise policy anchor | per-browser extension manifest inventory with first-seen/removed events; dev-mode and unpacked installs flagged by default |
| Extension permission drift | permissions escalated across versions (host-access widened, scripting added) | per-extension-id permission diffs vs manifest history; a widen without a user-visible update event alerts |
| Native-messaging hosts | the extension→native-binary bridge that bypasses the sandbox | native-messaging host manifest inventory per browser profile; non-package binary targets flag; parent-child lineage joins the Threat Graph |
| Policy-store writes | `/etc/opt/chrome/policies`, `/etc/firefox/policies` and the browser-managed-settings paths | provenance diff vs package or MDM owner; drop-ins from non-MDM lineage alert |
| Debug port exposure | `--remote-debugging-port` on local or non-localhost interface | process-arg + listener inventory; a debugging port on 0.0.0.0 is cross-tenant exfil waiting to happen |
| Service-worker persistence | background workers resurrecting on every browser start, outliving a tab close | long-lived SW inventory per extension-id; respawn-chain pattern reuses NOVEL-004 analytics |
| Credential/profile paths | mass reads of Login Data, Cookies, Local State by non-browser lineage | T1555.003 analytics on the profile path set; reads outside the browser process itself alert |
| Protocol-handler drift | custom URL-scheme handlers (`xdg-mime`, Windows app registration) registering new schemes that launch binaries | handler-registration events + mapping diffs vs provenance |
| Enterprise managed-config | force-install lists edited outside the MDM lineage | ChromeManagementPolicyProvider / `policies.json` diffs reconciled against the fleet policy source |
| Download gating | the download path is a dropper plane; `downloads.open` + autorun chains | download-event taps joined to the install-plane shscanner (install-plane row): a downloaded `.sh` opened by the browser hits the shscanner the same way an installer-lineage script does |

- [ ] `internal/browserplane`: one sensor module, inventories per installed browser and
  profile; no page content is read, ever — the row is manifest, permission and lineage
  state only, consistent with the free-reporting privacy rules.
- [ ] Managed-policy source-of-truth: the console carries the fleet's expected
  extension/policy baseline; drift from that baseline becomes the alert class rather
  than any name allow-list — provenance stays the FP suppressor.
- [ ] Extension model-card: popular extensions build an extension-prevalence table (opt-in,
  class-level) analogous to the file-prevalence surface — a brand-new extension with
  wide host permissions on two hosts worldwide is a very different signal from the
  same extension on 100M.
- [ ] Honest boundary: the plane sees state the browser exports to the OS; in-browser
  memory and intra-tab behavior stay inside the browser's own sandbox and are *not*
  claimed. Users wanting in-page detection need a dedicated browser extension — flagged
  as a documented future surface, out of scope for the sensor sweep.

---

## Email, chat & delivery plane — the inbound rail

Delivery-side detection has historically lived in gateways. The host sees email as
*files written into a mail store*, chat as *downloads landing in a user tree* and
collaboration docs as *browser-launched installers*; the plane's job is to catch the
delivery → open → execute hop that the gateway missed, with provenance for every
received file as the anchor.

| Surface | What the sensor does |
|---|---|
| Mail store watcher | watches Maildir/mbox/offlineimap and MUA attachment caches as file sources; new attachments trigger engine scans before the user opens them, same holds as install-plane for exec-perm paths |
| Draft/outbox watcher | drafts and outbox files are also scanned — a sent attachment is the moment compromise can turn into onward infection, and the plan does not pretend outbound is somebody else's problem |
| MUA plugin inventory | mutt/neomutt mailcap, Thunderbird extensions, Evolution plugins + their manifest paths — mailcap entries are a classic "pipe this to a tool" execution bridge; drift vs provenance flags |
| Chat/download trees | Element/Signal/Slack/Teams/Discord download roots registered as watched file sources; downloaded files inherit the same holds + content analysis as install-plane |
| Collaboration-doc opens | Office/OnlyOffice/LibreOffice launched with a browser-downloaded argument lands as a lineage pivot — docu-dropper patterns are structurally visible, not inferred from argv text |
| Calendar + ICS | calendar invites can carry attachment URLs; the ICS file is parsed as data (same AST discipline as shscanner) with URL-presence rendered honestly rather than content captured |
| Autoconfiguration drift | mail-client server/port and TLS-config changes outside the MUA process itself (profile-tamper class) |
| Rule-based forwarding | server-side forwarding rules are console-only; local client-side filters are inventoried per MUA, drift vs provenance flagged |

- [ ] `internal/mailplane`: file-source watchers only; the sensor never speaks
  SMTP/IMAP/POP3 and never reads mail content as text — the row operates on
  attachments and metadata as inventoried artifacts, not on message bodies, per the
  cleartext-plane privacy stance.
- [ ] Delivery-to-execution timeline: a scanned attachment opened by the MUA within
  a short window becomes a one-hop pivot in the Threat Graph — the delivery edge is
  explicit rather than inferred.
- [ ] Honest gap: webmail (Gmail/Outlook-on-the-web) is browser plane; the mail plane
  sees it only through the browser's download tree, and the coverage row says so
  instead of claiming webmail inspection.
- [ ] Gateway honesty: this is host-side defense-in-depth, not a replacement for an
  email security gateway. The row documents that boundary so operators do not
  substitute one for the other.

## DNS plane — deep sweep

The packet-guard and cloud-adjacent sweeps touched DNS; this is the plane in full.
Attackers increasingly operate at the resolution layer because it predates the
transport they can't inspect, and most host EDRs stop at `resolv.conf`.

| Signal | Analytic |
|---|---|
| Resolver drift | `/etc/resolv.conf`, `nsswitch.conf`, systemd-resolved/dnsmasq config diffs vs provenance; split-horizon override detection |
| Local resolver inventory | which process on this host answers port 53 — unauthorized resolvers alert, same provenance anchor as the service-balance row |
| Per-process resolver escape | processes using their own DNS stack (DoH/DoT libraries bundled, raw UDP/53 egress bypassing nsswitch) — first-seen per lineage |
| DoH/DoT adoption | per-process DoH/DoT endpoints inventoried; a non-browser process adopting DoH is a C2-channel smell under T1071.004 |
| Query-shape anomalies | subdomain-entropy, length distribution, TXT-record cadence, long-poll query patterns — DNS-tunnel fingerprints seen from the local resolver's logs where available |
| NXDOMAIN cadence | burst patterns consistent with DGA probing — the honest version flags cadence class, never domain content |
| TTL-zero and corporate-name oscillation | cache-poisoning fingerprints already in the netguard addendum, now reconciled with resolver-drift events for cross-plane corroboration |
| Hosts-file writes | the install-plane row's `/etc/hosts` tamper gets a resolution-plane companion — a host whose names redirect quietly can't see its own alerts |
| mDNS/LLMNR exposure | the netguard LLMNR poisoning row's inbound half gets its outbound half — this host *answering* names it shouldn't own flags |
| Chrome/Firefox trusted-root for DoH | browser-installed DoH endpoints and auto-upgrade state as posture; the plane says what resolver each browser profile is actually using |

- [ ] `internal/dnsplane`: aggregates config diffs, listener inventory, per-process
  egress classification, and resolver-log parsing where available — same evidence-class
  rules, kernel-asserted vs inferred.
- [ ] DNSSEC posture is a reported class: resolver supports and validates, resolver
  bypasses validation, or no validation — the choice lives with the operator, the
  state lives on the console.
- [ ] Encrypted-DNS honesty: a host that *should* be using DoH/DoT per fleet policy
  but isn't flags; a host using DoH/DoT when fleet policy pins a local resolver flags.
  No judgment on the choice; policy drift is the alert class.
- [ ] Content stays unread: query names are not stored or forwarded in any
  default-on surface — classes, cadence and shape only; a full-query capture mode
  exists as an explicit, opt-in forensics option labeled accordingly.

---

## Mobile & MDM — scoped honestly, not pretended away

Mobile endpoints are a plane the host-sensor can't own. The honest answer is to
*not ship a mobile agent* in v1 while owning the two sides a Linux-first EDR
actually can defend: the MDM/console *integration* with existing mobile fleets
(Jamf, Intune, Workspace ONE, Google Admin, Fleet, MDM-equivalents) and
mobile-device *approaches to a managed workstation* (USB tethering, HID over BLE,
AirDrop/Nearby-share mounts).

| Surface | Approach |
|---|---|
| MDM telemetry ingest | one standards-aligned adapter per supported MDM — attestation state, compliance posture, lost/stolen status, OS version drift — ingested as fleet metadata; incidents involving a user route to the right workstation + mobile posture at once |
| Mobile approach to workstation | when a mobile tethers via USB/BT and injects HID or storage, the device-plane rows already own it; the mobile approach adds *attribution* (which mobile device fingerprint joined the workstation) |
| Mobile OS attestation anchoring | PlayIntegrity/Attestation KEY / DeviceCheck receipts flow through as attestation evidence beside TPM quotes — the attestation plane extends to mobile without requiring CAU to run on mobile |
| Lost-device policy routing | an alert on a workstation whose user's mobile is "lost" per MDM escalates automatically — cross-plane evidence that already exists is finally used |
| Explicit non-goal | no mobile agent in v1. The surface is wide, the ecosystems ship their own agents, and shipping half-coverage would violate the "complete for its persona" rule. The MDM integration is where the plan commits. |

- [ ] `internal/mdm-adapter`: standards first (SCEP, CSV, SAML/SCIM where applicable),
  vendor-specific APIs behind the standards adapter — the one event model carries
  mobile posture the same way it carries kernel events.
- [ ] Review clock: the "no mobile agent" position reviews each Console-Phase cycle
  against the inversion table — if "cross-platform agent" becomes the field's
  entry bar, the position reopens; if the standards track makes host attestation
  the real anchor instead, the position persists.

---

## Hypervisor & virtualization plane

Phase 7 #7 chose eBPF; the kernel section introduced "vkernel" opt-in guest-introspection.
This plane makes the hypervisor side a full citizen: VMs host most of the fleet and
the hypervisor sees them in ways no in-guest agent can match. Honesty up front: a
fully malicious hypervisor is below the trust boundary this plan claims to defend —
the plane handles honest hypervisors seeing dishonest guests, and the row says so.

| Surface | Analytic / integration |
|---|---|
| QMP / libvirt event ingest | guest-start/stop, hotplug, snapshot, migrate events on the console; a guest hot-plugged with a USB-NIC is one hop from the netguard rows |
| Guest introspection (vkernel) | opt-in LibVMI/KVMI driven from the host — process/memory/network state of a guest seen from a layer the guest's rootkit cannot unhook, same labeled evidence class as any sensor tap |
| Snapshot-era attack class | snapshot restore quietly resetting a sensor's post-event ledger — guest reverting beyond its last console-receipt sequence number is a tamper-equivalent event, caught by the hardware-anchor monotonic receipts |
| Cross-VM pivots | the Threat Graph gains a hypervisor edge: "same hypervisor, same host NIC, same host disk" are first-class pivot queries for cross-tenant investigations |
| PCIe passthrough + SR-IOV | the device plane extends through virt — a VM with passthrough NIC is on the same wire as the host, and the netguard analytics apply by host identity |
| Nested virtualization | nested-virt enablement and L2 guest run — a posture row, not a verdict; an unexpected L2 is a lineage pivot into the vkernel surface |
| Live migration | migrating a sensor-equipped guest triggers re-attestation of the new host and re-anchoring of monotonic receipts; sensor identity is binding-aware |
| OCI runtime integration | containerd/CRI-O event bus ingestion for container-native fleets — Kubernetes was covered; the row makes containerd a first-class peer of libvirt |

- [ ] `internal/virtplane`: libvirt and containerd adapters first, hypervisor-vendor APIs
  behind them (Proxmox, oVirt, OpenStack Nova, vSphere) — one surface, many providers,
  same event model and same free-reporting privacy rules.
- [ ] vkernel is opt-in and auditable: every introspection operation lands as a labeled
  event in the ledger (operator saw what, when, under which policy); operators who do
  not opt-in get zero introspection by construction.
- [ ] Hypervisor honesty row: "the hypervisor is below the trust boundary" is a stated
  limit; the plan carries it in the standards program's event-transparency profile.

---

## Identity & cloud-identity plane

The cross-system sweep carried identity-config drift; this makes the identity *provider*
plane a full citizen. SSO, MFA factors, workload identities, OIDC/SAML relying-party
configs, and the service-account surface — most incidents land here and host-only
agents cannot see any of it.

| Surface | What the console does |
|---|---|
| IdP event ingest | SCIM push + SSE/audit log pull for Okta/Azure AD/Entra/Google Workspace/Keycloak — login telemetry, MFA factor adds/resets, impossible-travel, risky sign-ins, admin-role grants |
| Service-account inventory | cloud-provider service accounts and their key material (long-lived keys especially), IAM policy drift, cross-account role assumptions — the row anchors on provenance (the "which Terraform/Pulumi plan created this" edge) |
| Workload identity | OIDC federations, workload-identity bindings, trust-chain changes — a service account newly trusted by a new issuer is one of the louder cloud-attack signals, rarely alerted |
| Session-token theft shape | the host sees cookie-store reads (session plane) and egress endpoints; the console sees the *reuse* of those tokens from a different ASN — fused into one evidence story the host can't tell alone |
| MFA-fatigue cadence | push-notification cadence patterns distinguished from legitimate catch-up — same cadence analytics the brute-force row uses, in a different plane |
| Human/non-human mix | identity-origin labels on every event: human user, workload identity, service account — because a service account "logging in interactively" is itself the alert |
| Join-token lifecycle | sensor enrollment tokens are themselves cloud-identity-adjacent — the hardware-anchor row's duplicate-serial check gets its cloud twin: the same enrollment token observed from two network identities within a window flags |

- [ ] `internal/idplane` (console-side): one surface, many adapters; the hardest work is
  normalizing audit-log formats into the plan's one event model.
- [ ] Rotation and revocation are first-class: a stolen session token's revocation
  propagates to all sinks within the same CI-tested window the sensor-key rotation row
  requires.
- [ ] Boundary row: a compromised IdP is below the trust floor — the plane detects
  evidence that the IdP has been abused, and documents that root cannot be verified
  from a leaf. Same honesty line the hypervisor plane carries.

---

## Deception plane — canaries as first-class detection content

Canary files were a line in the Phase 9 blind-spot sweep; honeycreds appeared in the
cloud-adjacent sweep. This section promotes deception to its own plane with its own
model-card discipline — because a well-maintained deception set is the single most
reliable zero-FP tripwire a defender can own, and most products either ship it as a
checkbox or omit it entirely.

| Primitive | Where it lives | Fires when |
|---|---|---|
| Canary files | fleet-managed decoy documents and binaries at analyst-chosen paths | opened, read, exec'd, or hashed by any process; FP floor is ~0 because the file has no business being touched |
| Honeycreds | planted token-shaped strings in predictably-read credential stores (envfiles, config roots, mail stores) | the string appears anywhere outbound — console-side correlation across the fleet |
| Honey-processes | synthetic processes with attractive argv patterns (`cp /etc/shadow`, `curl ... | sh`) running under a cgroup that reaches no filesystem | any ptrace/`process_vm_read` against the honey-process is a strict TP |
| Honey-services | listener ports on canary profiles (fake SSH on 2222, fake RDP, fake Redis) carrying banner fingerprints that match no real service | connection attempt → first-class credential-collection source for the IR plane |
| Honeykeys | SSH keypairs planted in `~/.ssh/authorized_keys2` with distinctive comment strings; connection using the pubkey from anywhere flags |
| Honey-S3/registry URLs | canary URLs embedded in credential dumps the attacker is likely to steal — the console owns the receiver so attempts are logged with full lineage |
| Canary rules | detection rules shipped intentionally with no production matches, verifying the rule-build and alerting pipeline is alive end-to-end (ties the detection-liveness program)|

- [ ] `internal/deception`: an fleet-managed deception bundle with signed manifests —
  canaries are detection content, not configuration, and ride the same lifecycle
  as every other rule (promotion gates, model cards, re-review).
- [ ] Rotation on receipt: a tripped canary auto-rotates with a new string so the
  same artifact fires again if the attacker returns — tripwires with no stale state.
- [ ] FP floor stated honestly: canaries are low-FP only for the primitives above; a
  canary file that benign backup software reads flags, and the row documents this as
  a tuning problem the deception template can solve rather than a false positive to
  weigh against TPs.
- [ ] Legal posture: deception artifacts carry an attribution banner in content when
  the format allows it (document properties, SSH key comments), so a credulous
  investigator at a third party is not left trying to "attribute" an owner-planted
  canary against the owner.

---

## Autonomous-agent governance — the safety bounds for agent type 4

The console describes four agent types; the fourth (autonomous detection agents) has
the loosest constitution and the highest capability. "Human-in-the-loop approval gate"
is stated already; this section writes the rest of the contract so the agent can grow
without becoming a surface its own detection rules would flag.

| Bound | Rule |
|---|---|
| Scope | autonomous agents operate on *the detection content lifecycle only* — proposing rules, clustering corpora, triaging eval results. They never author sensor code, never author policy, never author other agents, and never author training data. |
| Approval | every promoted artifact ships only after human review *and* a measured FP/FN improvement on a held-out corpus the agent has not seen; the Phase 1 gates are the final arbiter. |
| Rate | per-day proposal caps per agent, per-day merge caps per repo — a runaway agent cannot flood the review queue; the queue IS the backpressure. |
| Isolation | each agent runs under its own identity and tool allowlist; the Phase 3 MCP sandbox contains inference and content synthesis in a cap-dropped, read-only environment with path confinement. |
| Audit | every proposal — accepted or rejected — joins the append-only audit journal, with the full prompt, tool-call sequence, and reviewer disposition. Journal is treated like detection evidence (hardware-anchor row). |
| Red-team | a standing adversarial-eval harness tries to prompt-inject agent context (via corpus comments, rule meta fields, intake feed content) once per cycle; a successful injection fails the agent's release train the way a bypass fails the engine's. |
| Rollback | every merged autonomous-agent proposal carries a one-click revert that re-plays the Phase 1 regression against the state immediately before merge; the standing revert contract (closing-the-loop §1) applies. |
| Model provenance | the agent's underlying model is pinned by hash, carries its own model card with training-data provenance, and is updateable only through the signed release channel — the same gate as detection content, applied to the thing that *writes* detection content. |
| Transparency | every published surface (coverage renderings, model cards, incidents) labels content *authored or materially informed by* an autonomous agent, so analysts and auditors can trace the proposal path. The label never becomes a credit line used to pad coverage. |
| Shutdown | a `cau agents --freeze` operator switch halts all autonomous agents instantly, with a published reason; the switch itself is an audited action and recovery requires out-of-band approval. |

- [ ] `internal/agentgov`: typed proposal objects, rate counters, red-team hooks and
  the one-click revert. Nothing an autonomous agent does bypasses this surface.
- [ ] The six-months-to-write rule: no autonomous-agent capability expansion ships
  without six months of audit journal to review against. The agent earns surface area
  by behaving, not by promise.
- [ ] Alignment honesty: these agents assist detection; they are not operators. The
  plan refuses the stance where "the AI shipped it" is a credible authorship claim —
  humans own every artifact's provenance.

---

## Observability & self-metrics contract

Every section budgets throughput, benchstat, drop policy, selftest health. There is
no single surface rendering any of it to an operator. This section writes the
observability contract so what the plan promises can be seen in one place.

| Surface | Content |
|---|---|
| `/metrics` endpoint | Prometheus/OpenMetrics on every daemon: engine, sensor, scanner, console, relay. Metric name schema is a published spec (`cau_<component>_<class>_<unit>`), semver'd like every other spec. |
| OpenTelemetry traces | end-to-end traces for every scan, every event path, every console query — opt-in on sensors to respect the agent-footprint budget, default-on in server components. |
| Structured logs | one JSON log schema (one more entry in the event-model registry), the sink matrix carries it like any other sink. |
| Honesty-index export | the standards program's honesty-index renders as a JSON artifact on the `/metrics` tree beside the counters — the thing buyers and auditors look at is the same thing operators look at. |
| Internal health | `cau selftest` is the single-command summary; `/metrics` is the dashboard-grade stream. The two never disagree — the selftest schema binds the metric names it summarizes. |
| Alerting primitives | reference Prometheus rule packs and Grafana dashboards ship beside the exposition surface — operators who use these do not have to invent the queries. |
| Trace content rules | traces carry *class labels* (event-class, verdict-class, sink-class), never payload content; the free-reporting privacy rule applies to observability the same way it applies to telemetry. |
| Metric honesty | drop-counter, event-loss-by-class, tap-alive counts and selftest-fail counts live on `/metrics` as first-class citizens — if the plan says a thing is measured, the metric says what and where. |

- [ ] `internal/metrics`: the one metric exposition stack; every module registers its
  counters here, drift from the naming schema fails the registry conformance.
- [ ] One contract per component: the sensor's `/metrics` schema is a document; the
  console's is another; the engine CLI emits a one-shot metrics artifact per run so
  CI tooling can pick it up without a daemon.
- [ ] Measure the measurer: `cau bench` compares `/metrics` exposition cost at target
  scrape intervals against the sensor's RSS and CPU ceilings; the observability layer
  itself fits within the tap-governor budget.

## Data governance & privacy — retention, residency, subject rights

The free-reporting rules keep *content* out of surfaces. Governance beyond content —
retention, deletion, access, residency, lawful-basis — is the companion contract.
Written down, measured, and tested like code, because privacy posture that lives in
a PDF decays the same way documentation does.

| Area | Rule |
|---|---|
| Retention classes | every event class has a retention window, published; defaults are short (14/90/365 by class), customer-settable with a hard upper floor by class. The event-transparency profile encodes the matrix. |
| Deletion propagation | a deletion request propagates to every sink the console wrote to — within the window the sinks' owners allow — and the propagation outcome lands as an audit artifact per sink. "Delete" is a verb with a measurable outcome. |
| Subject access | the console provides a subject-access workflow: all records *about this user identifier* across sensors and sinks, bounded by lawful basis — not a feature, a workflow. |
| Geo-residency | the console-plane deployment pins a region; cross-region ingestion is default-off; multi-tenant installs honor per-tenant pins. The architecture carries the row even when a single-region deployment makes it moot. |
| Lawful basis label | every ingest surface labels the lawful basis the data was collected under (legitimate interest, contract, consent, legal obligation) — the console won't accept an ingest surface it can't label, by construction. |
| Minimization audit | the free-reporting rules get a conformance suite: a sampled stream of outgoing events is verified against the content-class policy per release; captures leak nothing a developer forgot was captured. |
| Operator access to captured material | all operator reads of event content (not metadata) are logged, surfaced in the same audit journal as detection events, with the step-up approval gate from the console hardening. |
| Export portability | the subject-access and full-tenant-export paths produce the same STIX/ECS/OCSF-compatible bundle; moving to a different vendor's console is a bounded operation. |

- [ ] `internal/gov`: retention timers, deletion routers, subject-access query planner;
  the row is deliberately part of the console because retention is server-state.
- [ ] GDPR/CCPA/HIPAA alignment is a conformance axis of the event-transparency profile;
  compliance claims are only made where the suite verifies them.
- [ ] Residency honesty: a multi-region console is a future architecture, not a day-one
  feature. The row commits to the single-region path first with the data-model
  carrying the geo-pin so the second region is a scale change, not a refactor.

---

## Backup, disaster recovery & continuity — the console as a system of record

The console holds detection content, policy, incident history, audit journal and
subject-access material. If an incident takes out the console, the fleet goes
dark — and worse, the evidence necessary to understand what happened is gone with
it. This section commits the DR contract so continuity isn't a slide deck.

| Element | Rule |
|---|---|
| RPO target | 15 minutes for the audit journal and policy state; 1 hour for ingested event history. The published target enters the standards program. |
| RTO target | 60 minutes for the control plane (policy decisions, sensor connectivity); 24 hours for the full console UI including dashboards. |
| Backup frequency | continuous WAL shipping for the primary datastore, hourly consistent snapshots, encrypted at-rest under the console vault, offsite replication to a region chosen by the operator. |
| Restore drills | every quarter, a restore drill from the previous month's backup is scripted and executed in a sandbox; the drill result lands on the console status dashboard whether it passed or failed. A failed drill fails the release the same way a bypass fails the engine. |
| Air-gap continuity | the air-gap deployment ships with a documented operator playbook for backup rotation and restore — manual, scripted, and tested in CI against the same artifact pack as the release. |
| Catastrophic-loss policy | the published RTO is honored or the vendor says so, in plain words, in the subscriber portal — availability degradation is a reportable incident with its own postmortem commitment. |
| Sensor-side continuity | sensors operate autonomously during console outage: local verdicts, local policy from last-known-good signed bundle, spool from the transport ladder. Console returns and the spool drains; the ladder's rung 5 is the DR tool, not a corner case. |
| Replay | the audit journal is replayable — a restored console can regenerate secondary indexes from the primary journal, so DR tests exercise the fastest path to a working console. |

- [ ] `internal/dr`: backup orchestrator, drill harness, restore validator; the drill
  is in CI, not in a wiki page.
- [ ] Published status: the drills' pass/fail records are on the status page, same
  cadence as release notes — a vendor that cannot restore its own system is a vendor
  whose promises decay silently.
- [ ] Blast-radius minimization: console tenant isolation extends to backup — a
  restore request from one tenant never recovers another tenant's content; the drill
  verifies this per release.

## Insider-threat axis — detections that act differently when the attacker is logged in

Most of this plan assumes the adversary runs code the operator didn't author. The
insider axis is different: the adversary is logged in, uses sanctioned tools, and
leaves telemetry the operator typically treats as normal. The plan commits a few
rows specifically because this axis stays uncovered in commercial EDR by design —
their mission is malware, and insider abuse is reframed as a different product.

| Signal | What catches it |
|---|---|
| Access without purpose | identity-plane query cadence against repositories/data stores that the user has never read before, measured against their role peer group — "the first developer to read the HR partition" is an operational alert |
| Export cadence | per-user bulk-copy and transfer-tool invocation rate — rclone to a user-controlled destination from a laptop is the shape, not the tool |
| Clipboard-to-elsewhere | the session-plane clipboard tap paired with a cross-identity egress inventory — selection-of-sensitive followed by paste-to-personal flags |
| Repository tour | git clone/fetch patterns that cover a wide code surface the user did not previously touch — "last four weeks of commits across 500 repos" is one commit history nobody writes legitimately |
| MFA factor churn | an insider resetting their own factors ahead of a departure window — the IdP plane sees it; the row connects it to HR state when available |
| Deliberate obfuscation | a tool run with argv designed to resemble a different, benign tool — the analytic anchors on hash/lineage (NOVEL-004) rather than argv, so insiders don't defeat it by renaming |
| Role-boundary violations | sudo events outside the user's declared duty scope, cross-tenant access from a tenant-bound identity — governance rules in `specs/role-boundaries.yaml` define the measurable |
| Deletion before departure | mass delete, repo nuke, log-clean activity by a single identity in a short window — the T1070 family refocused on authored actions, not malware actions |

- [ ] `internal/insider`: the signals land in the same event model with an
  `authorship: insider | adversary | unknown` label from identity-plane fusion.
  Nothing new is captured; the existing captures compose a different question.
- [ ] Governance line: the insider axis has heightened privacy posture — identity
  labels, HR-state ingest and user-level analytics are opt-in per fleet profile, the
  profile is a documented management decision, and the lawful basis is explicit on
  every event.
- [ ] Workers' rights honesty: the plan commits to not implement productivity
  surveillance primitives (keystroke counters, idle timers, screen-sampling for
  monitoring) under the insider axis or any other. Detection content targets abuse
  shapes, not work patterns.

---

## Fleet-wide search & query language — the analyst surface

The Threat Graph (Phase 7 #8) carries pivots; the console surfaces incidents.
Analysts also need to *ask* questions the UI didn't predict — "every host that
loaded a kernel module not in /lib/modules/<kver>/ in the last 7 days." Without a
query language this becomes a dashboard-sprawl problem.

| Element | Rule |
|---|---|
| Language | a Kusto/SPL/EQL-shaped query language anchored on the one event model's schema; typed, auto-completed from the event-model registry (design-debt #1). |
| Scope | queries run over the console's audit journal, the event vault and the Threat Graph with the same syntax; the plane the query reads from is a filter clause, not a mode. |
| Cost | every query carries a cost estimator (rows scanned, bytes read, time-budget); over-budget queries ask the analyst to narrow — the console does not spend tenant capacity silently. |
| Saved queries | queries save as versioned artifacts (hunting content lifecycle), carrying their own model-card: cost, last-run, hits, authorship, fleet exposure (how many tenants have adopted the query). |
| Share | queries export as cross-tool-portable artifacts — Sigma, Lucene, Kusto, EQL where the shape allows; the standards program's spec dictates the mapping. |
| Live hunt | the same query can be registered as a *live hunt* — the engine runs it continuously against incoming events as a scheduled job, with its own rate-limit and model-card. |
| Privacy guard | query results obey the free-reporting rules — content-class access requires the console step-up approval, metadata-class is open to the analyst's scope. |
| Education | reference query packs ship as learning content — "top 20 Linux hunts" published alongside the detection content; the ten-path's substrate posture benefits from a lingua franca analysts recognize. |

- [ ] `internal/queryplane`: typed query executor, cost estimator, saved-query store,
  live-hunt scheduler. One language for every surface a question can be asked of.
- [ ] Portability test in CI: every saved query emits an equivalent Sigma rule (when
  the mapping exists); the CI verifies the Sigma rule round-trips.
- [ ] The query language is itself in `specs/` with a conformance suite, because an
  analyst-facing standard this plan ships is one that lasts beyond the first version.

## Operator ergonomics & accessibility — the thing that makes the plan survive the operator

Every detection section above has a flow where an operator must act. The ergonomics
of those flows decide whether the operator does act, or routes around them. This
section writes the UX contract — not visual design, which is downstream, but the
operator-side guarantees that make the plan ship-worthy.

| Rule | Why it is in a plan file |
|---|---|
| Alert density is a product goal | per-sensor alert rate budget per fleet profile, measured and published; a profile that exceeds the rate loses features by default until retuned — alert fatigue is the single-largest FP failure mode and it is a *product* number, not an operator's problem. |
| Explanation is first-class | every verdict renders *why* (which rule, which score, which offset) in both JSON and human text; the free-reporting rules explicitly keep the explanation un-watermarked and un-crippled. |
| Keyboard-first console | all operator flows are keyboard-navigable with announced focus states; the console passes WCAG 2.2 AA on CI (axe-core as a build gate). |
| Localization honesty | the console renders in English v1; the renderer is i18n-shaped so community translations ride a published glossary. Detection content model-cards localize separately. The plan does not ship pseudo-localizations; it commits to the operator reading what the author wrote. |
| Alert triage flows | the triage flow is scripted — one hotkey disposition per class; the audit journal captures the keystroke and the context, so analyst muscle memory and audit trail align. |
| Terminal operator UX | `cau` is a well-behaved CLI: JSON everywhere, exit codes everywhere, `--format` consistent across commands, `--quiet`/`--verbose` consistent, color-off by default when stdout isn't a TTY. The ergonomics live in `specs/cli-contract.md`. |
| Dark/light/high-contrast | the console carries three themes with contrast tested at build time; the operator who runs night shifts isn't an edge case. |
| Error-text standards | errors render as class + reason + minimal action + full-detail-under-key; the console doesn't make the operator read a stack trace to triage an ingest failure. |
| Response-latency floor | p99 of every operator action in the console is under a published threshold; interactive dashboards don't block on the vault. |
| On-call ergonomics | the on-call surface is a dedicated view: top open incidents, selftest health, drop-counter deltas — the one view the person being paged lands on at 3am. |

- [ ] `internal/opsux`: alert-density counters, triage-flow instrumentation, the
  CLI contract validator; ergonomic claims gate like any other claim.
- [ ] Accessibility is CI: axe-core + keyboard-only test runs as part of the console
  build gate; a regression blocks release the same way a bypass does.
- [ ] Documentation is operator-facing: every detection row has an "operator next
  step" paragraph in its model card — the row is only shipped when an analyst can
  know what to do with it in under a minute.

## Benchmark peers — honest comparisons, published cadence

The ten-path commits to a third-party scoring gate; the Phase 7 continuous
multi-vendor benchmark covers commercial labels. This section commits to the
*open-peer* benchmark that the OSS persona cares most about: how CAU compares
against the open stack the market actually uses. Published numbers, same corpora,
same gates, no asterisks.

| Peer | Position in the OSS stack | What we measure |
|---|---|---|
| ClamAV | the default file scanner; largest install base; signature-driven | FP/FN on the Phase 1 corpus, throughput per MB, memory per worker, pack-size and update-latency |
| YARA / YARA-X | rule engines; YARA-X is the modern Rust rewrite | compile-time, scan-time, memory, feature-coverage per rule — CAU uses go-yara; this is apples-to-apples per rule set |
| Suricata / Zeek | network-side peers; cleartext-plane and netguard rows are their adjacent surface | cleartext detection, protocol classification depth, cross-plane correlation deltas |
| OSQuery | host-state query engine; the inventory rows share a lot of its shape | tap-sum footprint vs. OSQuery's agent, inventory freshness, query latency at scale |
| Falco | eBPF-based runtime security; closest architectural peer | per-rule cost, false-positive rate on the Phase 1 corpus, coverage overlap and gaps |
| Wazuh | OSSEC descendant; combines agent + log analysis; a sink in Phase 7 #9 | event-model drift (do we feed Wazuh cleanly?), coverage overlap, FP/FN head-to-head where rules overlap |
| OpenEDR | the "comparable scope" peer (already its own gap section) | numbers from that section's parity test, published together |
| ClamAV-ML / Elastic Endpoint rules | ML-tier and public rule-pack peers | temporal-generalization performance, false-positive weight on same held-out corpora |

- [ ] `cau bench peers`: the harness supports external peers directly; a published
  CI workflow runs the peer matrix per release.
- [ ] Peer-honesty rules: every peer-comparison claim ships with the exact commit,
  config and corpus used; results reproduce from the published artifacts under the
  same CI budget. No cherry-picked peers, no hidden tuning.
- [ ] A peer who publishes a counter-claim gets the Phase 1 corpus and the published
  methodology for free; the third-party scoring gate takes it from there.
- [ ] Peer credit, written down: ClamAV, YARA, Suricata, Zeek, OSQuery, Falco, Wazuh
  and OpenEDR are the shoulders this stack stands on. The plan says so in prose so
  the comparison is positioning, not sniping.

## Internationalization & multi-tenant branding — the paid surfaces, done once

Multi-tenancy is a paid surface; branding and localization touch it. The policy
below exists so the paid feature grows along the natural architectural grain
instead of adding knobs no one asked for.

| Surface | Rule |
|---|---|
| Tenant branding | the console supports per-tenant logos and theme colors; no per-tenant HTML/CSS, no code injection by configuration — a brand is a token set, not a theme file. |
| Detection content localization | model-cards and operator-action text localize through a glossary file per language; a localization that drifts from the glossary (misses a technical term) is a CI-visible drift. |
| Alert localization | alert render templates are localized where community translations exist; the content is not — a technique name stays canonical in the one-event model so cross-locale correlation works. |
| Timezone and locale | per-user timezone, per-tenant default timezone, consistent locale handling in every rendered date; the audit journal keeps UTC-first with locale-rendering a view layer only. |
| RTL support | the console UI supports RTL locales (Hebrew, Arabic) at the layout level; axe-core testing runs under RTL in CI. |
| Date, number, currency | pricing is per-tenant currency where supported; the TCO calculator (Phase 7 #4) carries a currency switcher. |
| Compliance frames | the standards program ships EU-first alongside the US-first content — the Phase 4 EU-alternatives work (MISP galaxies, Malpedia, ENISA) stays an equal citizen, not a translation. |

- [ ] `internal/tenancy`: branding tokens, localization router, tenant-isolation
  invariants; multi-tenant branding re-uses the policy-schema (design-debt #3) so no
  new config surface appears.
- [ ] CI covers RTL and accessibility together; the plan doesn't ship an improved
  console that works only for one direction of text.

---

## Rollout, canary & release-safety mechanics

Detection content, sensor code and console code all ship. Each has a different
rollout risk shape. The release-safety mechanics commit the gates so a bad release
doesn't become a fleet incident.

| Artifact | Rollout rule |
|---|---|
| Detection content | staged rollout: internal corpus → canary fleet (10 hosts) → 1% fleet → 10% → 100%, with FP-rate gates at each ring; a ring whose FP exceeds budget halts progression and alerts the pack owner. |
| Sensor code | tiered rollout matching the above; sensors in a given ring self-report selftest state before the ring is called healthy; the drain-and-handoff work (design-debt #4) is per-ring. |
| Console code | blue/green deploy with the audit journal as the source of truth; the new console reads from a snapshot of the old one, writes new events to both until cutover. |
| Config/policy changes | signed, versioned, dry-run (`cau policy apply --dry`) renders the impact before the change takes effect — "4,382 hosts move from audit to enforce" is a reviewable artifact. |
| Emergency rollback | one-key rollback per artifact class, with pre-committed rollback artifacts (last-known-good signed bundle) available offline. Rollback is a drill, same cadence as DR. |
| Change-record ledger | every ring transition joins the audit journal with the rationale, metric values at transition and operator identity — a release is a sequence of auditable events, not a vibe. |
| Change-freeze | a published change-freeze calendar matched to major detection events (hunt weekends, conference weeks); release-cadence respects operator reality. |
| Feature flags | all new behavior ships behind a feature flag by default; the flag is a tenant-scoped policy object; killing the feature flag is a tested operation. |

- [ ] `internal/rollout`: rings, FP-rate gates, dry-run planner, rollback harness —
  all in one place so a sensor PR and a detection PR follow the same path.
- [ ] Canary fleet is the detection-liveness canary too: synthetic signal injection
  runs there and is the first-stage probe for every new release. Two guarantees in
  one program.
- [ ] Public release-safety record: the status page carries release-ring progression
  for every artifact class — operators see where in the fleet their class of change
  is before it reaches them.

---

## Documentation & reference program — the asset the OSS persona reads

The OSS persona is analyst-first; the console persona is operator-first. Both need
documentation that isn't an afterthought. This program commits the writing like it
commits the code.

| Audience | Deliverable |
|---|---|
| First-time user (OSS) | `cau` quickstart under 10 minutes, from install to first scan to first JSON; failure modes documented, not hidden |
| Rule author | a rule-authoring guide with the Phase 1 gates described, FP-measurement walkthrough, worked YARA/Sigma rules, model-card template |
| Operator | an operator handbook: console tour, incident flow, policy editor, exclusion governance, DR drill procedures |
| Developer | an architecture doc per phase, each component's event schema, the standards program's specs reproduced where they apply |
| Analyst | the top-20 hunts, the top-20 detections' operator-action paragraphs, the query language reference |
| Integrator | a cookbook per sink (Wazuh, Elastic, Splunk, Sentinel, Matano, Security Onion) + MDM/IdP adapter guides |
| Compliance | the event-transparency profile rendered as a plain-language reference, with the retention matrix and residency pins |
| Contributor | code-of-conduct, PR checklist, the standards-program conformance expectation, the test-before-promote discipline for content |
| Vendor-neutral references | the open-matrix (NOVEL + Phase 11) rendered as living documentation on the website, same source as the coverage artifact |

- [ ] `docs/`: every section above has a tracked owner, a last-reviewed date in the
  file front-matter, and a staleness gate — a doc more than 6 months since last
  review renders yellow in CI; 12 months red; the owner is responsible for the
  refresh same as a detection content review.
- [~] Doc-as-code: every documentation example runs as a test. Code samples that drift
  fail CI; command outputs are regenerated by CI, never hand-edited.
  **Flag-drift half shipped 2026-11-06** as `TestDocsExamplesUseRealFlags`
  (`cmd_docs_test.go`): every `cau …` line in a fenced block of `README.md`, `docs/**/*.md`
  and `wiki/*.md` is checked in-process against the real CLI: the command must exist and
  every flag must be one that subcommand defines (159 lines, 49 subcommand paths, 273
  flag uses on the first run; it found one stale example, `cau cluster --dir`, now fixed).
  Vacuity floors and a self-test with synthetic bad examples keep the checker honest.
  **Extended 2026-11-06** to the man pages, inline code spans, the three completion
  scripts (a completion may not offer a flag or subcommand its command rejects) and
  every command's own `--help` (all 396 flags defined in the source must be listed, with
  no allowlist). Two documented outputs that are pure functions of the tree
  (`cau eval policy`, the command table) are regenerated and compared. The first run
  found and fixed 38 mismatches: one man-page flag and 37 completion offers.
  **Open:** examples are checked, not executed; three output blocks (a scan report, an
  eval-gate failure, an annotated JSON shape) are not regenerated; Go snippets in
  `docs/library.md` are not compiled; Markdown flag tables are not checked; `cau-mcp` is
  checked against its source, not by running it. Completions still *omit* many real
  flags (logged by the test, not failed), most of all in fish.
- [ ] Operator-facing search: the docs site ships with the same query language the
  console uses — one syntax, two surfaces.
- [ ] The handbooks live under the same MIT license as the engine; the console's
  operator handbook has its own commercial license to match the console, but the
  content is complete — no "upgrade to see" sections.

---

## Appendix — glossary & terminology discipline

Terminology that recurs in this plan is pinned here so later readers (human or
agent) do not have to infer meaning from context. The entries are also what the
localization glossary (above) uses as canonical sources.

- **Attempt vs. compromise.** An attempt is evidence that an exploitation step was
  tried. A compromise is evidence that the step succeeded. The exploit-attempt ledger
  stores both as separate statuses; coverage reports count them separately.
- **Kernel-asserted vs. inferred evidence.** Kernel-asserted events come from kernel
  subsystems (netlink, LSM, eBPF taps on kernel points); inferred events come from
  user-space reconciliation. Every event carries the label.
- **Provenance.** The package/transaction system of record for a file, binary, config
  or key. The provenance DB (Phase 7 #5) is the authoritative benign anchor.
- **Prevalence.** How many hosts in the fleet (or the global OSS prevalence co-op) have
  observed the artifact. Fleet-relative prevalence is the FP suppressor and the
  novel-threat detector.
- **Peel.** The bounded unpeeling pipeline (NOVEL-012) that unwraps obfuscation
  layers. The peel is tree-shaped; the budget is global per sample.
- **Clove.** A unit of garlic-routed telemetry: an opaque bundle a relay can forward
  but not read.
- **Rung.** A step in the transport ladder. Rung transitions are timeline events.
- **Honest gap-mark.** A detection row explicitly marked `partial` or `planned` in
  coverage renderings — the plan's substitute for coverage inflation.
- **Honesty-index.** The scriptable artifact that renders coverage, FP measurements,
  selftest health and drop-accounting into a single thing a buyer can run.
- **Fusion.** The lattice combining multiple weak signals into a single verdict,
  rendering which inputs agreed and which disagreed.
- **Fleet-pinned.** An attribute (key, service, interface) explicitly registered as
  belonging to the fleet; the baseline the drift analytics measure against.
- **PQC.** Post-quantum cryptography (ML-KEM, ML-DSA, hybrid X25519+ML-KEM-768).
  Deliberately not "quantum encryption/QKD" — the plan refuses that terminology.
- **Attempt ledger.** The one unified store of attempt-class events (kernel, hardware,
  privilege, network, memory). Separate from the incident ledger.
- **Autonomous agent (type 4).** A detection-content-authoring agent governed by the
  autonomous-agent governance section. Never an operator; never a code author.
- **Benign-pattern contract.** A time-boxed, signed suppression of a specific benign
  pattern. Never a suppression of a true-positive class.
- **The ten-path.** The YARA/Sigma/Zeek-shaped outcome of becoming the layer the field
  plugs into. Market-gated, not code-gated.

## Phase 12 — Robustness, fuzzing & detection-quality hardening (engine) — DONE 2026-10-30 (follow-ups open)

Everything here is engine-side, measured, and standard-library only. The first
block is shipped (2026-10-29); the second block is scoped-but-measured-pending
and names the gate each item must pass before it ships, because the remaining
coverage gaps are hard by nature and the measure-or-don't-ship rule applies.

### Shipped

- [x] **Parser panic-safety.** A focused review and coverage-guided fuzzing of
      the PE/ELF parsers found and fixed a reachable 64-bit out-of-bounds read
      (a relocatable object whose `.symtab` declared a sub-minimum `sh_entsize`
      let the per-entry guard pass while a fixed-size struct read overran the
      buffer; `parseSymbols` now floors the stride like `parseDynamic`), an
      address-range overflow that let a wrapped section/segment hide content
      from the scanner (`addr-base < size` instead of `addr < base+size` in PE
      `sectionIndexForRVA` and ELF `vaToOffset`/`segmentIndexForVA`), and three
      32-bit negative-index conversions. Regression test:
      `TestParseELFSymtabTinyEntsize`.
- [x] **Per-file panic isolation.** `Engine.ScanFile` recovers per file: a
      panic in any detector degrades to a per-file error result instead of
      crashing the scan, so one hostile file can never drop a directory batch
      (`TestEngineHostileFileDoesNotBreakBatch`).
- [x] **Fuzz harness** (`make fuzz`): `FuzzParseELF`, `FuzzParsePE`,
      `FuzzAnalyze`, stego `FuzzScan`, `FuzzScanHeuristicsData`. Each ran
      millions of mutations with no crash; the seed corpora run as fast unit
      tests in CI, so they are permanent regression guards. "Never panic on
      hostile input" is now a documented contributing rule.
- [x] **Detection-robustness harnesses** for all four content detectors
      (`scanner/robustness_test.go`, `scanner/static/robustness_test.go`,
      `scanner/stego/robustness_test.go`): they measure the benign-transform
      envelope (case fold, UTF-16 widening, NUL-infixing, junk padding,
      base64) each detector survives on synthetic fixtures, lock in the true
      positives, and fail if a bundled rule becomes brittle. They found the
      one real gap below.
- [x] **wannacry rule hardened.** The robustness harness showed the wannacry
      YARA rule was case-sensitive while every other bundled rule carried
      `nocase`, so a case-folded sample evaded it. Closed with `nocase` on its
      (highly specific) indicator strings; the eval gate confirmed unchanged
      recall and zero new false positives.
- [x] **Error-handling swallows** fixed: `--output` close errors on written
      reports (`scan`/`coverage`/`rules`), `coverage.WriteText`, and the fuzzy
      TLSH re-parse in `FuzzyDB.Add`.

### Scoped, measured-pending — the remaining coverage gaps

`baselines/attack-coverage.txt` now declares one content gap (T1564.001),
after the encoded-executable detector closed T1140 and T1027.013. It is
deferred for a stated reason, not forgotten, and will not be padded into
"covered" without passing the named gate.

- [x] **T1140 / T1027.013 — encoded-executable detector (content-anchored).**
      Shipped 2026-10-30 as `scanner/encchain` (`--no-encchain` /
      `--encchain-threshold`): a bounded, multi-layer base64/hex decoder that
      flags a run decoding to a valid PE (`MZ` + `PE\0\0` at `e_lfanew`) or
      ELF header, up to a layer/byte/candidate cap. Content-anchored, never
      name-anchored; SUSPICIOUS-tier. Wired through the engine, fusion, the
      text/JSON (schema 1.4.0)/SARIF/OCSF reports, the `encchain` eval detector
      and a smoke fixture, and the coverage matrix. **Measured:** 0.019 % on
      139,860 benign files, every hit a genuine embedded encoded executable in
      offensive tooling or exploit docs. This is the cheap pre-pass of
      NOVEL-012; the full peeler (nested archives, decompression, emulation
      fallback) remains Phase 10 work. Coverage expectation flipped T1140 and
      T1027.013 from gap to covered.
- [ ] **T1564.001 — hidden artifacts.** Left to the sensor on purpose. A
      file scanner can only see a name↔content mismatch (an executable image
      with a hidden dotfile name or a document extension), and a filename is
      attacker-controlled surface, which the Phase 11 analytic-design rule says
      not to anchor on. The non-sheddable version of this detection needs
      filesystem attributes and persistence-dir provenance, which live in the
      sensor. If an engine-side weak-anchor variant ships, it ships labeled
      *partial by design*, like the discovery rows, never as full coverage.
- [x] **Shellcode atom strength (`$ror13`).** The 3-byte `{ C1 C? 0D }` atom is
      flagged weak by the rule linter. Tightening the wildcard to the ROR
      encodings is recall-safe but trips YARA's slow-string warning;
      lengthening it to a 4+ byte invariant is recall-affecting. **Gate:** a
      shellcode corpus (Phase 1 real-corpus work) to measure recall before the
      atom is changed. Until then it stays broad and only counts toward "3 of
      them".
      Status 2026-11-06: the 3-byte atom is no longer in `rules/rule_list.yar`. The
      shellcode rule now carries 4- and 6-byte forms (`$hash32`, `$hash64`: the rotate
      followed by the add), which the linter accepts. The row stayed open because its
      own gate was not met: no recorded recall measurement for the lengthened atoms
      against a shellcode corpus, so whether the change cost recall was unknown.
      **Measured 2026-11-10** (`scanner/shellcode_corpus_test.go`): a synthetic corpus
      of the byte sequences the technique is made of — the PEB module walk plus the
      rotate-and-add — in six forms (the conventional `ror edi,13` and `ror r9d,13` with
      both add directions, a rotate of another register, and a rotate of another
      amount). The narrow rule catches **3 of 6**: exactly the three conventional forms
      it claims. The Go pass (`tradecraft.hashLoopNear`) catches **6 of 6**: it accepts
      any rotate and any register, which is what the rule's own comment says it is for.
      So the lengthened atoms cost no recall on the forms the rule claims, the forms it
      declines are covered by the other pass, and the system's recall over the corpus is
      6/6. The fragments are byte sequences, not working shellcode: they carry no
      payload and are built in the test rather than committed, as the corpus policy
      asks.

### Process additions

- [x] **The detection-quality program's own gate, run against real tooling.**
      The program above says "measure or don't ship"; this is the measurement.
      The lab corpus's misses were read class by class and the content was
      widened to cover the behaviours they turned out to be — web shells that
      relay or resolve rather than execute, Windows script behaviour with no
      ordinary use (a command name assembled from unrelated strings, a
      password list walked against a logon interface, a shell command file
      with a remote icon, an application-server console, a boot sector written
      to a physical drive, a binary rebuilt from text and started), packed
      credential dumpers read through the library list the packer kept, and
      the living-off-the-land shapes (a signed binary with no business being
      handed a URL, a redirected system-root variable, the `NTDS.dit` backup).
      **Measured 2026-11-12** (`make eval-lab`, build `v0.3.0-2-g8cdb25b` plus
      this change): lab dev **166 → 194 of 222 (74.8 % → 87.4 %)**, held out
      **171 → 179 of 280 (61.1 % → 63.9 %)**, LOLBAS/GTFOBins catalogue
      **109 → 128 of 408 (26.7 % → 31.4 %)**. False positives unchanged: dev
      3 of 2,368, held out 6 of 2,398, wide sweep 38 of 24,999.
      A first version that gave every dev miss its own eight-point class
      reached 210 on dev and 179 on heldout with one more false positive
      (the two it had over this one are packed dumpers convicted on function
      names that survive packing by luck), and convicted 63 of
      7,686 public administration scripts where this one convicts 7:
      the gate is the held-out number and the benign populations, never dev.
      The lookalikes are pinned by tests drawn from those false verdicts.

- [x] Fold `make fuzz` into a scheduled (not per-PR) CI job with a longer
      `FUZZTIME`, committing any crasher as a seed under `testdata/fuzz/`.
      **Shipped 2026-11-06:** the nightly scheduled run of the `fuzz` lane uses
      `FUZZTIME=4m` per target (pushes and pull requests keep 30s). The job has read-only
      repository access, so a crasher is published as an artifact and the red run is the
      alert; committing the seed stays a human step.
- [x] Extend the detection-robustness harness to every bundled rule as new
      rules are added, so the nocase/wide contract is enforced per rule, not
      per sampled family.
      **Shipped 2026-11-10** (`scanner/robustness_contract_test.go`): the harness now
      reads every rule the repository ships, builds a synthetic sample from that
      rule's own literals, and checks that the rule still fires under the benign
      perturbations — a rule that declares `nocase` must survive upper- and
      lower-casing, a rule that declares `wide` must survive UTF-16LE, and every
      rule must survive junk before or after the content. A rule that keys on
      the file's structure (a PE header, a size) cannot be sampled from a text
      sample and is named as such rather than passed over in silence. The
      contract covers a rule the moment it lands, so a new rule is measured
      without anyone remembering to add it. Measured on the eight bundled rules:
      six sampled and holding their contract, one (`linpeas_script_in_binary`)
      losing the case perturbation because it declares no `nocase` — the
      measurement the row asks for — and two named as not samplable (a
      hex-atom rule and a rule that keys on the file's structure).
- [x] A `cau rules lint --strict` gate once the `$ror13` atom is resolved, so
      the ruleset is warning-clean and strict lint can block merges.
      **Shipped 2026-11-06:** `make lint-rules` now runs `cau rules lint --strict`,
      so a warning fails the gate CI runs. The bundled ruleset (12 rules) is clean
      under it; a deliberately weak rule fails it.

### Encoded-executable detector — next layers (NOVEL-012 continued)

The shipped `scanner/encchain` peels base64/hex to a PE/ELF header. The
remaining NOVEL-012 surface, each with its own FP gate:

- [ ] **Decode-to-indicator, not just to a header.** Re-run the string/YARA
      indicators over a decoded layer so a base64-wrapped mimikatz or
      PowerShell cradle is caught even when the decode is a script, not an
      executable. Gate: measured FP on the benign text population; cap the
      re-scan cost per file.
      **Peeler half shipped 2026-11-06:** `peeler.WithLeaves(maxBytes)` exposes the
      decoded leaves (at most 8, chosen by a scheduling-independent order, bounded,
      off by default so the scan path pays nothing).
      **Engine half shipped 2026-11-10** (`scanner/engine_leaves.go`, the
      `PeelIndicators` engine option, on in `cau defend`): the detection rules and
      the heuristic indicators run over the decoded layers, and the hits are
      attributed as `peel.rule-match` and `peel.indicator-match` evidence. A rule
      match flags on its own (60, the same weight a revealed executable carries) —
      a base64-wrapped script that trips a rule is the case the row is about — while
      a heuristic indicator is corroboration only (25, below the threshold). Two
      bounds keep the cost honest and the false positives down: only leaves the
      peeler took for *code* are rescanned, and only chains with a deliberate
      encoding or substitution in them — compression alone is packaging, so a
      gzipped document that mentions a payload is a document.
      **Measured 2026-11-10 on 139,984 benign files** (`/usr/share/doc`,
      `/usr/share/man`, `/usr/lib/python3`, `/usr/bin`, `/etc`): 1 file flagged by a
      decoded-layer rule — a Metasploit-framework *documentation* page that embeds
      a base64+gzip PowerShell payload. That is a true positive about the content
      and a false positive about the context, and it is the whole of the false
      positives (0.0007 %). Five heuristic indicator hits, none of them flagging on
      its own. The per-file cost is capped at 8 leaves, 1 MiB per leaf and 4 MiB in
      all.
- [~] **Container layers.** gzip/zlib/zip/xz as decode layers alongside
      base64/hex, with the decompression-bomb caps the plan already requires
      (ratio and absolute-size limits, a global budget shared across layers).
      Status 2026-11-06: gzip, zlib, raw DEFLATE and bzip2 ship as layers in
      `internal/peeler` (not in `scanner/encchain`) under one shared per-sample
      budget. **Open:** zip members and xz as peel layers (xz has no standard-library
      decoder; the vendoring decision comes first).
  **Zip shipped 2026-11-06** (`internal/peeler/zip.go`): an own bounded central-directory
  reader (stored and deflate; encrypted members skipped and counted; zip64 and
  prepended data handled; nothing written to disk; member names never evidence; nested
  zips through the same tree budget). A zip that *is* the sample, or sits under
  compression only, is packaging; a zip under an encoding or substitution is a layer.
  Measured on 1,645 local zip-family files: 1,640 clean, 4 documentation archives
  `peel-exhausted` at score 0 (soft walls, no floor), 1 new true positive (a pentest
  tool's base64+zlib reverse-shell templates inside its jar); +42 ms CPU per archive on
  average, worst 3.0 s, bounded by the 5 s wall. **xz stays open:** it needs LZMA2 plus
  the xz container, and the LZMA1 decoder in `scanner/uefi` cannot be imported by the
  peeler; the right shape is lifting that decoder into a shared `internal/` package.
  xz is recognised and reported as opaque.
- [x] **Chain-depth as a signal.** Report the peel depth as its own weighted
      observation (a 4-layer wrapper is suspicious whatever the leaf), with the
      depth distribution measured on the benign population first.
      Status 2026-11-06: the peeler reports `max_depth` and uses depth to gate its
      classes (a revealed executable or script counts only at depth >= 2), but there
      is no class that scores depth alone. That stays open on purpose until the benign
      depth distribution is measured, which is this row's own gate.
      **Shipped 2026-11-06, after the measurement the row required:** on 131,253 benign
      files (`/usr/share/doc`, `/usr/share/man`, `/usr/lib/python3*`, `/usr/bin`,
      `/etc`) the depth distribution was 0: 106,656, 1: 24,557, 2: 40, 3+: 0. The
      `peel.deep-chain` class fires at depth 4 (one layer of margin), scores the depth
      component that already existed (30 at depth 4, crossing alone at 6) beside a
      payload class, never instead of it, and fired on 0 benign files.
- [ ] **Provenance reconciliation (console).** An embedded encoded executable
      inside an official package (installer, security tool) is expected; the
      console's provenance DB (Phase 7 #5) attenuates those so the engine's
      SUSPICIOUS tier is not noise in the fleet view.
- [ ] **Egress URL-param variant (T1048.003 / NOVEL-006).** The same
      decode-to-indicator logic over URL query parameters, console-side, for
      encoded exfil — the network complement of the file-side detector.

## Risks

- **Adoption vs. revenue.** Free detection+prevention too weak → nobody adopts. The paid
  console too thin → nobody pays. Mitigation: the paid line is *multi-agent management*,
  which is inherently stateful server-side value a single free agent structurally cannot
  provide — not a withheld detection or prevention feature. Single-host users get a
  complete product free (detect *and* respond); buyers pay to run and govern a fleet from
  one pane.
- **Licensing leak.** A license check in a free binary is unenforceable. Mitigation:
  enforcement lives only in the closed console server (the multi-agent pane); the agent
  and engine carry no license boundary at all — there is nothing to leak because the
  agent gives away all detection and prevention by design.
- **AI agent licensing ambiguity.** Agents are unmetered; only the console that manages
  many of them is licensed. Settle this before building governance surfaces, not after.
- **Feature migration.** Memory/fileless detection and response are strong
  differentiators, and they ship **free in the agent** — the differentiator that earns
  revenue is managing many agents, not the per-host capability. Keep the roadmap honest:
  the paywall never creeps onto a single host's detect-or-prevent surface.
- **Scope creep from gap-sweeping.** This plan has had five self-audit passes and keeps
  growing; the discipline that keeps it honest is that every added row must earn its
  phase, its owner and its Phase-1-measurable test. Mitigation: the design-debt audit
  runs each release cycle, and a row without owner and measurement regresses to the
  backlog rather than shipping as a promise.
- **Standards-program dilution.** Writing standards nobody adopts turns strict specs
  into private requirements. Mitigation: the standards-program's own honest-boundary
  rule — a spec with no non-CAU passing conformance regresses to "requirement".
- **Autonomous-agent drift.** The type-4 agents can expand their effective scope
  through unaudited corner cases. Mitigation: the agent-governance red-team runs on
  every release train, and the shutdown switch is a one-command operator action.
- **Over-footprint.** The sweep count makes the tap-sum design-debt row structurally
  critical; without the tap governor and policy compiler landing early, the agent-
  footprint sales point (Phase 7 #7) erodes release by release. Mitigation: those two
  design-docs are blocking for Console-Phase B.
- **Open-matrix freerider risk.** Publishing the honesty-index invites free-riders who
  publish CAU's methodology minus the measurement discipline. Mitigation: the
  methodology itself is open and conformance is the enforcement — "freerider" is
  what the field will call anyone who publishes without passing the suite.
- **Over-centralization of the console.** The console accrues identity, deception,
  DR, backup, insider-threat, standards and governance surfaces; a compromise there is
  catastrophic. Mitigation: the defense-in-depth hardening section carries the console
  rows; privilege-separation inside the console is a Phase B deliverable; the audit
  journal survives console loss by construction.
- **Legal exposure from deception.** Honeycreds and deception artifacts carry attribution
  banners (above) to avoid attribution confusion. The lawful-basis labels and the
  insider-axis privacy posture are the operator-side control; the plan documents the
  legal posture rather than claiming all jurisdictions are the same.
- **Localization and accessibility debt.** Shipping English + axe-AA at launch is the
  commitment; drift beyond that becomes technical debt that the design-debt audit tracks
  alongside architecture debt.
