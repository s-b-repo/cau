A transparent, open-source malware detection engine in Go. Fifteen detectors read
every file once, every finding is explained with a labeled class and an
ATT&CK technique, every report is machine-readable with CI exit codes, and an
evaluation harness gates every detection change against a measured baseline.

## What it does

| Detector | Question it answers | Result |
|---|---|---|
| **Hash signatures** | is this exact content known? | MALICIOUS with the threat name |
| **YARA** (in-process libyara, per-file timeout) | does it contain patterns a rule describes? | MALICIOUS with rule, namespace, meta and matched strings at their offsets |
| **Heuristics** | does it name suspicious capabilities? | SUSPICIOUS with a capped score, the categories responsible and their ATT&CK techniques |
| **Static structure** (own PE, ELF and Mach-O parsers, entropy, TLSH / ssdeep / imphash / telfhash) | is it *built* like something that hides? | SUSPICIOUS with labeled anomaly classes: packer, RWX sections or segments, forged build record, implausible signer, appended payload, stripped section table, non-system program interpreter, writable `RPATH`, libc interposer, unsigned kernel module, constructor outside code, encrypted Mach-O, similarity to a known sample |
| **Invisible codepoints** | does this text or code carry hidden codepoints? | SUSPICIOUS with every zero-width, bidi-override, TAG or variation-selector codepoint, its line, and the context rules that excused the rest |
| **Encoded executable** (base64/hex, multi-layer) | is an executable hidden behind text encoding? | SUSPICIOUS with the decoded PE/ELF, the encoding and the layer depth |
| **Obfuscation-chain peeler** (parallel tree unwrap through every common base, rot and Caesar, budget-walled) | is a payload stacked behind *several* encoding/compression layers? | SUSPICIOUS at chain depth ≥ 2 with the ordered chain signature (e.g. `base64>gzip>base64`); `peel-exhausted` when the budget wall is hit |
| **Shell Link (.lnk)** ([MS-SHLLINK] parser) | is this Windows shortcut a weaponised launcher? | SUSPICIOUS with interpreter arguments, encoded/hidden-window flags, env-var path obfuscation, executable target and icon lure |
| **OLE macro** ([MS-CFB] + [MS-OVBA]) | does this Office document carry a malicious VBA macro? | SUSPICIOUS with auto-exec entry points, shell/interpreter and download calls, obfuscation and embedded-object lures |
| **PDF document** (bounded lexical scan) | does this PDF auto-run code or carry a payload? | SUSPICIOUS with auto-run actions, embedded JavaScript, Launch, embedded files and JS exploit primitives |
| **ISO container** (ISO 9660 + Joliet) | is this disk image a mark-of-the-web-bypass lure? | SUSPICIOUS on the `.lnk`-plus-payload smuggling shape, hidden payloads and `autorun.inf` |
| **Linux software package** (.deb/.rpm/Arch/Flatpak/AppImage/Docker/Snap) | does an install-time script run root-level tradecraft? | SUSPICIOUS with the maintainer/scriptlet behaviours scored: curl-into-shell, reverse shell, dropper, persistence, sandbox escape |
| **Archive** (ZIP/TAR/gzip, recursive) | is this container a bomb, a Zip-Slip, or a lure wrapping a payload? | SUSPICIOUS with decompression-bomb caps, path-traversal members, double-extension lures and executable payloads |
| **CHM help file** (ITSS directory) | does this help file smuggle an executable, shortcut or script? | SUSPICIOUS with embedded PE/LNK/HTA/VBS/PS1 payloads a help file has no reason to carry |
| **Tradecraft** (behaviour in scripts and payload bytes, through decoded carriers) | what does this file *do*, when it names no family and has no odd structure? | SUSPICIOUS with the behaviour: web shells, network shells, in-memory loaders, living-off-the-land abuse ([LOLBAS](https://lolbas-project.github.io) and [GTFOBins](https://gtfobins.github.io) breakouts, `sudo` and setuid privilege escalation), trusted-SaaS command channels (the full [lolol.farm](https://lolol.farm) catalogue — [LOLC2](https://lolc2.github.io), [LOLFSaaS](https://lolfsaas.github.io), [LOTTunnels](https://lottunnels.github.io), [LOTWebhooks](https://lotwebhooks.github.io)), EDR-bypass primitives ([ArcticFox detection-bypass catalogue](https://github.com/s-b-repo/arcticfox-c3/blob/main/docs/Detection-Bypasses.md): anonymous in-memory exec via `memfd_create` + `execveat`, kernel process-name camouflage via `prctl(PR_SET_NAME)`, `LD_PRELOAD`/`RTLD_NEXT` shims, PAM-stack backdoors, systemd unit hijacks, `/proc/self/exe` self-delete, GitHub README dead-drops, ICMP and DNS-TXT covert channels, open-redirect heartbeats with zero-width codepoints, TLS domain fronting), shellcode in the clear or in a byte array or encoded blob |
| **Fusion** | do several detectors agree, even below their own thresholds? | one fused verdict naming the sources that agreed, their roles and techniques, plus attack-path chaining |

## The runtime planes

The detectors above read files. Three more layers read the host as it runs, and
`cau defend` joins all of them into one incident:

| Plane | Command | Question it answers |
|---|---|---|
| **Process** | `cau ps` | is anything running that a benign system would not run? Fileless execution, masquerades, injection hooks, network shells and pipe relays, set-uid shells |
| **Network** | `cau net` | what is this host talking to, and who on this host is doing the talking? Every socket the kernel holds — per network namespace, so containers are covered — attributed to its process and executable: fileless egress and bind shells, known-bad peers, handler ports, DNS-plane escape, connect sweeps, beaconing cadence, and neighbour-table tampering. See [docs/network.md](docs/network.md) |
| **Persistence** | `cau persist` | what will run again after a reboot or a login? |

Response is tiered the same way everywhere: `--respond stop` freezes a confirmed
process with its memory intact, `--quarantine` seals a confirmed file in the
vault, `--block-exe` asks the kernel guard to refuse it, and `--netblock` drops
its peers — in cau's own firewall table, with an expiry the kernel holds, and
never an address the host itself needs.

The kernel guard's event log is read as evidence, not as a hint. Each event
carries the process's start time (the same clock and unit as field 22 of
`/proc/<pid>/stat`), so an event is matched to the process it happened to and
to no other — a PID is reused, and the log outlives the processes it names.
That is what lets a refusal from the guard be pointed at a process, and what
lets an exec the kernel saw and *allowed* be a finding rather than a footnote.

**What gates it is the evidence, not a flag.** Under `cau defend` these are on
by default, each degrading to a warning where the host cannot carry it out (no
kernel guard, no firewall); `--report-only` turns the whole surface off to watch
first, and `cau ps` and `cau net` on their own stay read-only until asked.
Nothing acts on a single layer's opinion: only live state, a known-bad
identification or two independent layers agreeing license a machine to act, and
a network block additionally refuses every address the host needs to stay
reachable.

`cau defend --ingest <path>` takes in telemetry from other hosts and sensors —
another cau host's incidents, an OCSF event from a firewall or an IDS, a plain
JSON line — and joins it on the peer address, the one identifier two machines
agree on. Remote evidence corroborates an incident; it never directs the
response, because a PID and a path mean nothing off the host that produced them.

Hash and YARA hits are MALICIOUS; scores are SUSPICIOUS and never promoted;
the lattice raises CLEAN to SUSPICIOUS only when independent sources
corroborate each other, and never lowers anything.

## Beyond the file and the host

| Area | Command | What it gives you |
|---|---|---|
| **Boot chain** | `cau boot-scan` | MBR and both GPT copies, every EFI binary on the ESP, Secure Boot state and dbx, WPBT and option ROMs. Read-only, and a test fails the build if it ever gains a write |
| **Firmware** | `cau firmware` | a UEFI image's module inventory, through LZMA and nested volumes, with every module body run through the YARA rules |
| **Hardware identity** | `cau hwid` | DMI, NIC addresses, TPM PCRs and the entropy source, with `--record` and `--check` against a baseline, and `--redact` for sharing |
| **Threat intel** | `cau intake` | STIX, MISP, MalwareBazaar, LOLDrivers and TAXII 2.1 with a persisted cursor, recording the provenance of every signature |
| **SIEM delivery** | `cau scan --format`, `--sink-url`, `--wazuh-url` | fourteen formats, including STIX, ECS, CEF, LEEF, GELF, RFC 5424 syslog and OTLP, delivered over UDP, TCP, TLS or HTTPS. Free, and `cau defend` streams to Wazuh by itself |
| **Honesty** | `cau honesty` | one document of what is covered, what was measured and whether the content is intact, with no overall score |
| **Supply chain** | `cau bundle sbom`, `cau verify-self` | a reproducible CycloneDX SBOM per binary, and signed release manifests. `cau update` refuses an older signed bundle |

## Measured, not asserted

Every row below was re-derived on `v0.3.0-2-g8cdb25b` (2026-11-11) unless the
row says otherwise. Re-run them with `make eval-lab`, `make eval`, and the
measurement tests named in [docs/evaluation.md](docs/evaluation.md).

| Claim | Where it was measured | Result |
|---|---|---|
| heuristics stay quiet on real tools | 349 files, Kali's Windows tool set | detections 60 → 28 after the rescoring; credential dumpers and injectors still detected |
| static structure does not flag packed benign tools | 49 PE files in the same set | 43 score 0, nothing crosses the threshold, UPX and ASPack named below it |
| static structure stays quiet on a Linux system | 4,999 ELF files under Kali's `/usr/bin`, `/usr/sbin`, `/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu`, `/usr/libexec`, `/usr/lib/systemd` (7,301 files walked); 40 kernel modules | 0 cross the threshold, 21 carry one weight-1 observation, every module scores 0, a UPX-packed `ls` scores 6 with the packer named |
| invisible-codepoint pass is usable on real text | 70,200 benign text artifacts | 69 detections (0.10 %), 35,187 legitimate uses excused by named rules |
| fusion adds no false positives | 349 files | 0 fused-only detections, 0 new false positives |
| the network sensor stays quiet on an ordinary host | a synthetic eight-daemon host (sshd, systemd-resolved, nginx, firefox, curl, postgres and a developer's `python3 -m http.server`), and a stock Kali desktop read **as root**: 48 sockets, 40 of them attributed to a process | 0 findings at the shipped threshold in both. At `--threshold 1` the live host lists 4 sockets as inventory — NetworkManager's raw ICMPv6 socket and ARP packet socket, and wpa_supplicant's two 802.1X ones — and nothing sums to the threshold. One host and one run, not a fleet |
| the root-level read is what found the one real false positive | the same stock host, before the fix | NetworkManager scored 5 — exactly the threshold — because a raw socket (3) and an ARP packet socket (2) shared one subject. Unprivileged runs had hidden it: a socket whose holder cannot be read has no executable to group by. The capture classes now weigh **who holds the socket** over what it is (packaged: 2 and 1; unpackaged: 6 and 3), and `TestNetworkManagerShapeStaysQuiet` pins it |
| the time-based analytics stay quiet on real traffic | the same host, `--interval 20s --threshold 1` for 10 samples over 3.3 minutes, during ordinary desktop use | 0 beaconing, gateway-MAC-churn and sweep findings; the only classes that fired across all 10 samples were the same 4 inventory sockets each time. The window was capable of producing a beacon — a 20-second poller would have made 10 connections in it, well past the 4 the analytic needs — so the zero is meaningful rather than vacuous. It does **not** cover a slow beacon: a 60-second cadence makes only 3 connections in 3.3 minutes and could not have been detected either way |
| blocking is reversible and leaves the host's firewall as it was | a real kernel: block two addresses, list them back, unblock one, `cau net clear` | the `inet cau` table carried both elements with kernel-side expiry (`timeout 1h expires 59m47s`), `cau net blocks` read them back through real `nft -j` output, and after `clear` the `nft list ruleset` digest was byte-identical to the one taken before the first block, with 0 tables left. Re-applying the ruleset left 8 rules, not 16, and did not drop the live element |
| the response policy refuses what the host needs | every address class a machine could be asked to block | loopback, unspecified, multicast, link-local, this host's own addresses, its default gateways and its configured resolvers are refused with a reason; `netblock.Check` is a pure function and tested as one |
| encoded-executable detection is low-noise | 139,860 benign files (Kali doc/python/nmap/metasploit trees) | 0.019 % detections, every one a genuine embedded encoded executable |
| **detection rate on tools the rules were not written from** | 280 real offensive samples held out by tool (`make eval-lab`) | **63.9 %, up from 25.4 %**, 6 false positives in 2,398 benign files (0.25 %); public tooling, not a malware detection rate, see [the caveats](docs/evaluation.md#the-lab-corpus) |
| false positives across a wide benign sweep | 25,000 files, held-out excluded | 0.15 %; all 4 hits from the behavioural pass are genuine offensive material |
| a dropped script is flagged as it lands | `cau defend` on a 12-core host, the real binary through the real watcher, a one-line PHP file | median under 1 ms on a quiet host, 7 ms during a 20,000-file sweep; worst seen 141 ms, in the first instant after start. At load 15 to 25: median 3 to 85 ms, worst 158 ms. The quiet-host figures predate the scanning changes; on the final build, measured only at load 31 to 35: median 23 to 177 ms |
| a dropped script and the cron entry that runs it become one confirmed incident | same, through the real persistence audit | median 3.4 ms on a quiet host, 13 ms during a sweep; worst seen 244 ms. At load 15 to 25: median 21 to 176 ms, worst 337 ms |
| scanning takes longer the larger the file | all detectors over `/usr/bin/bash` (1.4 MB), which is what an alert on a real binary waits for | about 0.3 s on a quiet host, 1.3 s at load 22, down from 3.7 s; most of it is regexes over the whole binary |
| running detectors at once costs no throughput | the smoke corpus, serial and parallel engines built from one tree, 10 runs each in random order | 10 % faster at the median |
| skipping regexes that cannot match changes no result | 10,410 files, mostly offensive tooling, against a build without the filter: every finding of every detector compared | 0 differences in 1,513 files with findings across 112 classes; about 100 s rather than 529 s, at a higher load |
| kernel guards load and behave | the running kernel in QEMU, real verifier and real `execve` (`cau-kernel`: `make vm-test`) | 57/57 scenarios through the real CLI, including `ssh host cmd` shells, inetd listeners, blocking a running file, the guard's process identity and fail-open |
| the response really happens, and only where it should | the running kernel in QEMU, the real binary with its defaults as real root (`make vm-respond`) | 19/19: a shell on a TCP socket and a deleted binary stopped, one killed, a file moved to the vault and caught again when re-dropped; argv text, `/etc` and PID 1 left alone |
| nothing regresses silently | `corpus/smoke` on every push | 100 % recall, 0 false positives, gated in CI against the committed baseline |
| coverage claims are derived, not typed | `cau coverage` on every push | 95 techniques with content — 92 covered, 3 held honestly as `partial` — and no declared gaps, gated against `baselines/attack-coverage.txt`; every bundled rule passes `cau rules lint` |

## Project

This repository is the **engine and agent**: detection content, scanning
library, MCP server, evaluation harness, and all on-host prevention/response
(quarantine, restore, block, kill, canaries), under MIT. The kernel guards live in
the sibling `cau-kernel` project. **Detection and
prevention are free and unmetered, forever.** The only paid artifact is a
separate control plane whose job is *managing a fleet of these free agents* from
one pane — central policy, cross-host timelines, multi-tenancy — inherently
stateful server-side work that adds no detect-or-prevent capability a single
free agent lacks. The paywall is multi-agent management, not withheld features.
The roadmap, the reasoning and the measurements behind each phase are in
[PLAN.md](PLAN.md).

It started as a fork of the Astra AV Engine educational series; the
implementation has since been reworked for correctness and measurability,
and the episode structure survives in the detectors' names.
